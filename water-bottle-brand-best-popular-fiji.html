However, Dasani, frequently the subject of <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>online memes</a> over its quality, also earned the highest <i>unfavorability</i> levels of all tested brands.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">BlueTriton’s Poland Spring took the top spot in the Northeast, while its Ice Mountain brand tied Fiji for first in the Midwest, likely reflecting the outsized presence of bottling hubs in those respective regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Coca-Cola's Vitamin Water and Topo Chico, Primo Water Corp.’s Mountain Valley Spring Water and PepsiCo Inc.'s Lifewtr performed much better with younger consumers than with older ones. Brands best known for sparkling products, such as Nestlé Waters' Perrier, Acqua Panna and San Pellegrino, generally landed in the mid or bottom tiers.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">When asked to elaborate on why certain bottled water brands were their favorite and least favorite, respondents cited taste most often, with descriptors like "crisp," "smooth," "fresh" and "pure" frequently used to describe their favorite brands, and "flat," "dirty" and "acidic" used for their least favorite. Consistency of taste experience, cost and bottle quality were also mentioned.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Still, a significant portion of respondents said they did not have a single favorite or least favorite bottled water brand, highlighting the importance of creative differentiation in the space.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The price paradox and the power of branding&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">So why do consumers have largely positive opinions of premium brands like Fiji and Evian if they also identify price as a primary factor in purchase decisions? Common Good’s Reedy said it comes down to advertising.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">"To communicate a distinctive position in a category where there is only an incremental difference in most options, you have to solve for brand identity," Reedy said. "And with bottled water, that typically comes down to product packaging and placement."&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Riese echoed this sentiment, noting that most consumers wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between bottled water brands within an average range of minerality in a blind taste test.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The outsized value of packaging is reflected in the category's <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>relatively low traditional ad spend</a> compared with other beverage products like beer and soft drinks. The bottle itself, when viewed on store shelves, needs to do a lot of the talking.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In the sea of pastel blue hues and cylindrical bottles, "any uniqueness goes a long way to creating endearment in consumers' minds," Reedy added.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">With its square bottle, Fiji does just that. In emailed comments, Clarence Chia, senior vice president of marketing for Fiji, noted the brand’s container is its "own fashion staple, making it the preferred choice of celebrities and tastemakers."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Fiji and other top water brands have made strategic partnerships a big part of marketing efforts, too. It has a presence on the red carpet for many Hollywood award shows, including the Grammys and the Golden Globes (remember the “<a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Fiji Water girl</a>”?). Evian has been a longtime sponsor of major <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>tennis and golf </a>events. PepsiCo’s water brands also have a history of relationships with major sports organizations, including the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>NFL</a> and <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>NCAA</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Through these alignments, water brands move beyond the grocery store shelf and "create meaningful connections with the cultural experiences people love," Reedy said.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">And while the bottled water industry is dominated by a few beverage giants, one brand has emerged with a roar in recent years by leveraging packaging and placement strategies in a radical way: Liquid Death.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>White (or blue) space</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Founded in 2019, canned water brand Liquid Death is reportedly already valued around <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>$700 million</a> after its irreverent ads — they frequently feature boundary-pushing and unexpected tropes like hard-partying kids or rockstar grandmas — <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>earned the brand a cult following</a>. The product is available in more than 60,000 retail stores nationwide, and is one of the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>top-selling</a> drinking waters on Amazon.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Packaged in a tallboy-style can with branding reminiscent of an energy drink or beer, Liquid Death targets a renegade persona previously untapped by the water market, which recently has focused on appealing to more health and wellness-conscious consumers.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>media interviews</a>, Chief Executive Mike Cessario has said he sees Liquid Death as an entertainment brand first and a water brand second, believing that humorous, culturally relevant creative is the key to engendering brand loyalty in a category where <i>functional</i> product differences are limited.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Despite its rapid rise, most adults (65%) said they have not heard of Liquid Death, according to the survey. The brand landed near the bottom of the net favorability rankings among most generations and regions, likely due, in part, to its young age compared with the rest of the bottled water market.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Other brands could look to Liquid Death’s success on Amazon as a way to carve out their own niche in the market.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“Food and beverage has been much slower to adopt direct-to-consumer trends because of freshness and perishability concerns,” Moquin said. “But without those issues, delivery services offer water brands another opportunity to differentiate.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Putting a cap on things</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Though consumers prefer bottled water to tap, the industry likely has some challenges ahead that could tip the balance. Questions surrounding the industry’s environmental impact aren’t going anywhere as consumer concerns about climate change <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>remain high</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">More than a quarter of Gen Z adults (26%) and millennials (27%) said they feel "guilty" about drinking bottled water, while 22% of all adults said the same. Reusable water bottles are <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>growing in popularity</a>, and some communities where bottling occurs are <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>pushing back </a>against the nearby water companies. Calls for banning single-use plastics globally are also gaining <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>momentum</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">As a result, many water brands are incorporating sustainability into products and marketing materials. According to Chia, Fiji has transitioned nearly 65% of its bottle volume to recycled plastic, and is investing $2.5 million into energy efficiency initiatives on the islands from which it sources. In 2021, Nestlé Waters announced a similar <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>commitment</a> to regenerate the water cycles.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Industry experts expect this push-and-pull dynamic to continue to shape the industry. Ultimately, though, the top water brands have shown resilience amid a rapidly changing global economy.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">"One would think brands that put water in a bottle and ship it worldwide would burn out so quickly in this consumer environment," Reedy said. "It's just not happening though. Water truly sits in its own category in consumers’ minds."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZMGzsc2dZKydpKmys7%2BOsJitnaJir7DA06WcZpqilrulecGeqq1loKS9trjAq2SfoZqe</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwater-bottle-brand-best-popular-fiji.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwater-bottle-brand-best-popular-fiji.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwater-bottle-brand-best-popular-fiji.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwater-bottle-brand-best-popular-fiji.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwater-bottle-brand-best-popular-fiji.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwater-bottle-brand-best-popular-fiji.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1461989-ashley-burgos-biography-bernice-burgos-daughter.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1461989-ashley-burgos-biography-bernice-burgos-daughter.html>Ashley Burgos biography: what is known about Bernice Burgos' daughter?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./world-cup-2022-american-fan-viewership.html>Americans Are More Excited for the World Cup Than Usual</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./world-cup-2022-american-fan-viewership.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
