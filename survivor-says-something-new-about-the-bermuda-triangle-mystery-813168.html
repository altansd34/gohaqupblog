<time>31 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The airplane involved was a&nbsp;<strong>Beechcraft Bonanza</strong> single-engine aircraft. Onboard, pilot Bruce Gernon had two passengers: his father and business partner. They took off from <strong>Andros</strong> Island in&nbsp;the Bahamas and headed northwest for the <strong><a href=# title=Florida data-link=tag>Florida</a></strong> coast. It&nbsp;was <strong>December&nbsp;4, 1970</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1a0/0c5/5299c65142bf89a85df3dc106b.png><p>If&nbsp;you draw up&nbsp;a&nbsp;map, trace a&nbsp;line connecting the <strong>island of&nbsp;Bermuda</strong>, <strong>Puerto Rico</strong>, <strong>Miami</strong>, and back to&nbsp;Bermuda, what do&nbsp;you get? Yes, it’s a&nbsp;<strong>Bermuda Triangle</strong>&nbsp;— a&nbsp;sinister polygon known for mysteriously swallowing over <strong>2,000 ships</strong> and <strong>200 aircraft </strong>over centuries! Bruce Gernon’s plane was within its hungry grasp...</p><p>But this was a&nbsp;typical flight Bruce had made dozens of&nbsp;times before! The trip usually took about an&nbsp;hour and a&nbsp;half with no&nbsp;hiccups or&nbsp;mysterious phenomena whatsoever! The men were no&nbsp;more concerned than you would be&nbsp;during your daily commute to&nbsp;work.</p><p>Oh, but this time would be&nbsp;different. They would face very unusual circumstances, indeed...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b04/e0a/96153951cf9334dcb6c78132f5.png><p>Bruce took off and started gaining altitude. Strange things started happening right from the get-go. At&nbsp;an&nbsp;altitude of&nbsp;about <strong>1,000 feet (300&nbsp;m)</strong>, he&nbsp;noticed a&nbsp;small cloud up&nbsp;ahead. But... it&nbsp;kept growing. Not from the plane getting closer&nbsp;— this thing was actually getting bigger in&nbsp;size! Bruce had to&nbsp;fly through&nbsp;it, and he&nbsp;came out the other end just fine.</p><p>Another mysterious cloud appeared at&nbsp;<strong>11,500 feet (3,500&nbsp;m)</strong>. This one was massive, and Bruce had no&nbsp;other choice but to&nbsp;fly through it&nbsp;too. So, he&nbsp;concentrated, took a&nbsp;deep breath, and in&nbsp;they went.</p><p>At&nbsp;that moment, it&nbsp;got dark as&nbsp;night all around the aircraft. Not a&nbsp;single sliver of&nbsp;sunshine got through. But this wasn’t a&nbsp;storm cloud, and it&nbsp;wasn’t raining. Bruce was starting to&nbsp;get worried. And then&nbsp;— BAM! —&nbsp;he&nbsp;saw flashes of&nbsp;white light! They would appear and vanish quickly like lightning. But this pilot knew this certainly was no&nbsp;lightning. The flashes were so&nbsp;bright, they lit up&nbsp;the whole space around them.</p><p>Bruce kept flying for another 30&nbsp;minutes when he&nbsp;realized this was the same cloud he&nbsp;had gone through earlier when he&nbsp;started to&nbsp;climb. But now the cloud was cylindrical, and the plane was flying through its center. It&nbsp;was about 1&nbsp;mile wide and seemed endless. Bruce thought he&nbsp;could never get out of&nbsp;that trap. But a&nbsp;minute later, he&nbsp;saw light at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the tunnel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/329/1a7/cff12551b3a8a24d6e0c4f9d9f.png><p>He&nbsp;kept that yoke straight ahead&nbsp;— he&nbsp;was almost out of&nbsp;this nightmare! But all of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden, unexplainable things started happening again. The walls of&nbsp;the cloud tunnel began to&nbsp;narrow —they were closing in&nbsp;on&nbsp;the plane! The navigational instruments started wigging out. The compass was spinning by&nbsp;itself counterclockwise.</p><p>The electronic instruments were all malfunctioning. It&nbsp;was like the plane was being operated by&nbsp;something else, or&nbsp;it&nbsp;was moving inside some kind of&nbsp;current. All of&nbsp;Bruce’s attempts to&nbsp;take control were to&nbsp;no&nbsp;avail.</p><p>He&nbsp;kept flying through that tunnel, bound and determined to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;this thing and live to&nbsp;tell the tale. The walls kept narrowing, smaller and smaller, wrapping like a&nbsp;vortex. Bruce was running out of&nbsp;time&nbsp;— he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;this place fast! The next 20&nbsp;seconds were the most intense of&nbsp;his life. But then...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f4b/1b2/d5ab5b507b910370de607941f8.png><p>He&nbsp;burst out of&nbsp;this foggy trap! As&nbsp;Bruce described later, he&nbsp;felt weightless for 5&nbsp;seconds as&nbsp;his plane left the tunnel. The clouds dispersed, and now the aircraft was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;grayish haze. The men let out a&nbsp;big sigh of&nbsp;relief.</p><p>He&nbsp;immediately grabbed the radio and contacted ground control. Bruce wanted them to&nbsp;determine his location. But when the dispatcher looked at&nbsp;the green screen, his face became contorted with confusion...</p><p>Bruce’s plane wasn’t on&nbsp;the radar! It&nbsp;was as&nbsp;if&nbsp;the thing was invisible! But then the dispatcher said the aircraft was already in&nbsp;Miami airspace. Bruce was utterly shocked by&nbsp;this information. It&nbsp;just couldn’t be&nbsp;true.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/037/e64/b32dce520faa6a6088d7df87ab.png><p>The distance the Beechcraft was supposed to&nbsp;cover was about <strong>250 miles (400&nbsp;km)</strong>. Remember, the whole trip usually took around <strong>90&nbsp;minutes</strong>. But this time, it&nbsp;took just <strong>47&nbsp;minutes</strong> to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the destination! This model of&nbsp;aircraft can only cruise at&nbsp;about <strong>180 mph (290&nbsp;kph)</strong>.</p><p>Do&nbsp;the math, and anyone would understand that this was physically impossible. The dispatcher must have made a&nbsp;mistake. But when the clouds parted, Bruce saw that he&nbsp;really was over <strong>Miami</strong>!</p><p>The plane landed safely, and it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;try and solve this mystery. So&nbsp;what happened on&nbsp;that flight? Bruce checked the remaining <strong>fuel</strong> and his watch. After a&nbsp;short calculation, he&nbsp;was only more confused. The plane hadn’t gone through the amount of&nbsp;fuel it&nbsp;should’ve.</p><p>Bruce couldn’t have been wrong. He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;very experienced pilot. By&nbsp;his early 20s, he&nbsp;already had 600 hours of&nbsp;flight under his belt. And he&nbsp;was all-too-familiar with this airspace he’d flown countless times. All the evidence in&nbsp;hand seemed to&nbsp;indicate that Bruce’s plane just skipped over almost half the entire distance...</p><p>The man thought about this bizarre occurrence for a&nbsp;long time. He&nbsp;even consulted with professors and experts. But none of&nbsp;them could give an&nbsp;exact answer to&nbsp;what happened that day.<strong> </strong>So, he&nbsp;came up&nbsp;with his own theory and even wrote a&nbsp;book about&nbsp;it. Bruce thought it&nbsp;all came down to&nbsp;this “<strong>electric fog</strong>” with white flashes.</p><p>Others, however, theorized that dark energy was responsible for this time leap. Yes, that same <strong>dark energy </strong>responsible for the expansion of&nbsp;the universe. This energy could’ve curved space-time like a&nbsp;black hole, forming this strange tunnel. Bruce accidentally hit&nbsp;it, but he&nbsp;was lucky to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;there. That’s how he&nbsp;got into Miami airspace so&nbsp;fast. But dark energy is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;theory attempting to&nbsp;explain the unexplainable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b88/610/5f14b15ce68eac4b1882f11d9c.png><p>To&nbsp;this day, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;real answer for how Bruce was able to&nbsp;travel that distance in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;short time. But some details can still be&nbsp;explained. Archive records show that <strong>84&nbsp;sunspots</strong> were recorded that day, as&nbsp;well a&nbsp;huge solar wind moving almost <strong>440</strong> miles per second (700&nbsp;km/s)! This would cause disturbances in&nbsp;the Earth’s magnetosphere that could throw off the plane’s instruments and radars. So&nbsp;Bruce’s version that he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;an&nbsp;“electronic fog” could be&nbsp;right!</p><p>And about these weird clouds. The thing&nbsp;is, they’re pretty commonplace things in&nbsp;this area. Zones with low and high pressure are constantly colliding there. The result: storm clouds. Perhaps that cloud growing before Bruce’s eyes was simply two massive air currents crashing into each other...</p><p>But so&nbsp;far, no&nbsp;one has been able to&nbsp;explain how the plane got to&nbsp;Miami so&nbsp;fast. Well, maybe in&nbsp;the future, the truth will be&nbsp;revealed. In&nbsp;the meantime, it&nbsp;remains another mysterious riddle of&nbsp;the <strong>Bermuda</strong> Triangle. But it’s still by&nbsp;far not the most shocking incident there...</p><p>In&nbsp;1945, a&nbsp;total of&nbsp;5&nbsp;planes went missing in&nbsp;the Bermuda Triangle all at&nbsp;once! On&nbsp;December&nbsp;5, some Navy student pilots were training in&nbsp;the area. The day’s lesson: navigation. Ironically enough, they couldn’t find their way back to&nbsp;the base and got lost. Many people assumed they ran out of&nbsp;fuel. This is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;have caused the incident, but the circumstances were very strange...</p><p>The students were under the supervision of&nbsp;an&nbsp;experienced lieutenant who had 2,500 flight hours. He&nbsp;would never let a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;newbies go&nbsp;so&nbsp;far that they’d get lost.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4ca/32d/0bc4cd5b5da11d64675701100d.png><p>Three years later, a&nbsp;passenger jet headed to&nbsp;<strong>Miami</strong> from <strong>Puerto Rico</strong> disappeared in&nbsp;the same area. There were <strong>29&nbsp;passengers</strong> and <strong>3&nbsp;crew members</strong> on&nbsp;board. The weather was clear throughout the flight.</p><p>But experts believe that when the plane was about 50&nbsp;miles off the coast of&nbsp;Miami, it&nbsp;could’ve been hit by&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong wind that knocked it&nbsp;off course. Years later, divers found a&nbsp;similar-looking plane in&nbsp;the waters. But since it&nbsp;was lacking certain details and registrations, no&nbsp;one could confirm that it&nbsp;was the missing Miami-bound aircraft.</p><p>The next month, in&nbsp;<strong>January 1948</strong>, another plane went missing in&nbsp;Bermuda.&nbsp;<strong>25&nbsp;passengers</strong> and <strong>6&nbsp;crew members</strong> just vanished somewhere between Azores and Bermuda. The mystery of&nbsp;this plane’s disappearance&nbsp;— along with countless others&nbsp;— remains unsolved.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMC2vtWiraiqXaiuur%2BMrKamnaSdtq%2BzjKecsGWRl7y2wIytn55lkpq%2FrsHDmmStqpmWu6i4xGaksqukmr%2B6eZdqampuaGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsurvivor-says-something-new-about-the-bermuda-triangle-mystery-813168.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsurvivor-says-something-new-about-the-bermuda-triangle-mystery-813168.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsurvivor-says-something-new-about-the-bermuda-triangle-mystery-813168.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsurvivor-says-something-new-about-the-bermuda-triangle-mystery-813168.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsurvivor-says-something-new-about-the-bermuda-triangle-mystery-813168.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsurvivor-says-something-new-about-the-bermuda-triangle-mystery-813168.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-worlds-oldest-woman-dies-at-128-after-living-through-3-centuries-811891.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-worlds-oldest-woman-dies-at-128-after-living-through-3-centuries-811891.html>The &amp;quot;Worlds Oldest Woman Dies at 128 After Living Through 3 Centuries</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./subtitles-dubbing-streaming.html>Subtitles vs. Dubbing in International Content</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./subtitles-dubbing-streaming.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
