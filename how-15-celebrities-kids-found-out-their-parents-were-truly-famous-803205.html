<time>28 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>When we&nbsp;are children, we&nbsp;don’t have a&nbsp;very complete perception of&nbsp;what is&nbsp;going on&nbsp;around&nbsp;us, especially with our parents. We&nbsp;tend to&nbsp;call them “dad” or&nbsp;“mom” and think that those are their names, and we&nbsp;are not even entirely clear about what they do&nbsp;for a&nbsp;living. This also happens with the children of&nbsp;celebrities, who, when they find out how famous their parents are, are usually very surprised.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> found the stories about the “surprises” that the children of&nbsp;15&nbsp;celebrity couples got when they realized how popular their parents are.</p><p><h2>1. Ricky Martin’s sons Valentino and Matteo</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/82c/b64/a962ce59f499a57163698619fa.jpg><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>interview</a>, Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin commented that whenever his twins traveled to&nbsp;concerts with him, he&nbsp;kept them backstage. When they were old enough to&nbsp;see one of&nbsp;their dad’s shows, they got a&nbsp;surprise.</p><p>“One day, when the kids were old enough, I&nbsp;told them to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the front of&nbsp;the house. After they saw the lights and the whole show, they came up&nbsp;to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and said, ’Daddy, you’re Ricky Martin!’ I&nbsp;replied: ’I’m not Ricky Martin, I’m your father! And they immediately replied with ’No, no, no, no, you’re Ricky Martin,’ and everything changed.”</p><p><h2>2. Lincoln and Delta, the daughters of&nbsp;Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/36a/4d5/ad5b9256d0a3188df52215bdfb.jpg><p>On&nbsp;<i>The Late Show</i> with Stephen Colbert, comedian Dax Shepard <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>shared</a> what happened when his daughters found out that he&nbsp;and his wife <a href=# title="Kristen Bell" data-link=tag>Kristen Bell</a> were famous.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the girls asked him if&nbsp;people listen to&nbsp;his <a href=# title=podcast data-link=tag>podcast</a> because of&nbsp;him or&nbsp;because of&nbsp;his co-host. Dax explained that they initially started listening because of&nbsp;him. His daughter asked him, “But why?” and he&nbsp;said, “Well, baby, because daddy is&nbsp;famous!” His daughter was completely shocked and asked, “Does Mom know?” and Shepard replied, “Of&nbsp;course, my&nbsp;love, your mom is&nbsp;more famous than I&nbsp;am!”</p><p><h2>3. Kaia Gerber, daughter of&nbsp;Cindy Crawford</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/93d/b99/63a2c25bad97b308d37c95a303.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2017, supermodel Cindy Crawford’s daughter Kaia Gerber <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>shared</a> with <i>Teen Vogue</i> magazine how she first learned about her mother’s fame. “I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;was on&nbsp;my&nbsp;eighth birthday at&nbsp;Disneyland when&nbsp;I started to&nbsp;understand what was going&nbsp;on. I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;take pictures with the princesses, and everyone wanted to&nbsp;take pictures with her,” the model said.</p><p><h2>4. Brooklyn Beckham, son of&nbsp;David Beckham</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/005/ed1/26bd965e69b6381cc0626d5d4b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2017, Victoria and David Beckham’s son, photographer Brooklyn Beckham, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>told</a> Wonderland magazine how he&nbsp;discovered at&nbsp;age 13&nbsp;that his father was a&nbsp;sports celebrity. “I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=soccer data-link=tag>soccer</a> game and people were shouting my&nbsp;dad’s name and my&nbsp;reaction was, ’What, oh&nbsp;my&nbsp;gosh, I&nbsp;don’t see it&nbsp;that way.’”</p><p><h2>5. Moses, son of&nbsp;Gwyneth Paltrow</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a3/de6/971bf25d639e30903d83a40b3a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2013, <a href=# title="Gwyneth Paltrow" data-link=tag>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>discussed</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview what happened to&nbsp;her son Moses when he&nbsp;found out about her fame. They were going to&nbsp;go&nbsp;see Justin Bieber and immediately her son made the connection: Justin Bieber and the other people he&nbsp;thought were so&nbsp;cool actually knew who his mom was because she appeared in&nbsp;the <i><a href=# title="Iron Man" data-link=tag>Iron Man</a></i> movie. Considering this was all a&nbsp;recent thing for him, he&nbsp;concluded, “Ah, you’re in&nbsp;the movie!”</p><p><h2>6. Brandon and Dylan, sons of&nbsp;Pamela Anderson</h2></p><p><a href=# title="Pamela Anderson" data-link=tag>Pamela Anderson</a> revealed how her sons, Brandon and Dylan, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>questioned</a> her when they found out about her fame.</p><p>“They came up&nbsp;to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and said, ’Mom, are you Pamela Anderson!’ and I&nbsp;said, ’Yes!’ And they were like, ’What?’ They were like, ’What? Why are people saying that? Are you really Pamela Anderson?’ and I&nbsp;said, ’Well, yes!’”</p><p><h2>7. Luca Comrie, son of&nbsp;Hilary Duff</h2></p><p><a href=# title="Hilary Duff" data-link=tag>Hilary Duff</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>said</a> that her son Luca Comrie gradually became aware of&nbsp;her celebrity status. At&nbsp;first, the little boy saw his mother on&nbsp;magazine covers and assumed it&nbsp;was just something moms&nbsp;do. That was until a&nbsp;classmate revealed his mother’s name to&nbsp;him (or&nbsp;so&nbsp;Hilary believes). She clarified that Luca, at&nbsp;first, didn’t even know her name, he&nbsp;simply called her “mom,” and one good day, her son told her: “I&nbsp;know your name, Hilary Duff.”</p><p><h2>8. Jack Quaid, son of&nbsp;Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c5/ef9/bb0b94523fb16ed122d2dfdeb6.jpg><p>Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid’s son, Jack Quaid, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>opened up</a>&nbsp;about what it&nbsp;was like to&nbsp;grow up&nbsp;with famous parents.</p><p>"I&nbsp;fully recognize that the way&nbsp;I grew up&nbsp;wasn’t normal, but at&nbsp;the same time, despite what my&nbsp;parents did, they’re still mom and dad. It’s not like sitting around with some characters at&nbsp;dinner, my&nbsp;dad was never Jerry Lee Lewis at&nbsp;my&nbsp;graduation, and nothing was handled that way. From my&nbsp;perspective, if&nbsp;the other kids&nbsp;I grew up&nbsp;with had had famous parents as&nbsp;actors, then they would have thought, ’That’s the way of&nbsp;the world!"’</p><p><h2>9. Georgia May, daughter of&nbsp;Mick Jagger</h2></p><p>Georgia May Jagger, the youngest daughter of&nbsp;Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall, was asked in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>interview</a> if&nbsp;she was aware as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child that her parents’ jobs were not ordinary jobs, to&nbsp;which she replied:</p><p>“Not really, when&nbsp;I went on&nbsp;tour with my&nbsp;dad, I&nbsp;knew he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;musician, but they were my&nbsp;parents. I&nbsp;still think of&nbsp;my&nbsp;mom as&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;a&nbsp;clown, a&nbsp;cool one, but still a&nbsp;clown.”</p><p><h2>10. Alexa Ray, daughter of&nbsp;Christie Brinkley and Billy Joel</h2></p><p>When she was little, Christie Brinkley and Billy Joel’s daughter, Alexa Ray, didn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>know</a> her parents were 2&nbsp;international stars. While growing up&nbsp;on&nbsp;Long Island, they tried to&nbsp;hide from her how famous they were, so&nbsp;she had no&nbsp;idea. Christie commented that when everyone would wave at&nbsp;them, Alexa just thought they were popular in&nbsp;the neighborhood.</p><p><h2>11. Michael Joseph, son of&nbsp;Michael Jackson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3db/2e7/6af2d65f6a8faf951c362f852e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>interview</a> with <i>Good Morning America</i>, Michael Jackson’s son, Michael Joseph Jackson, said it&nbsp;never occurred to&nbsp;him or&nbsp;his siblings that their father was a&nbsp;pop star.</p><p>“I&nbsp;think when we&nbsp;first realized&nbsp;it, was when we&nbsp;saw videos of&nbsp;him performing. Then I&nbsp;thought, ’OK, it’s normal to&nbsp;see women fainting at&nbsp;concerts.’ But what surprised me&nbsp;the most was when&nbsp;I saw big-muscled men fainting, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought, ’There’s something else going on&nbsp;here,’” he&nbsp;laughed.</p><p><h2>12. Luca Dotti, son of&nbsp;Audrey Hepburn</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/604/979/e741935b5694e64865165dacd9.jpg><p>Luca Dotti, Audrey Hepburn’s youngest son, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>commented</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview for <i>People</i> that he&nbsp;didn’t know his mother was a&nbsp;world-famous movie star.</p><p>“She was just a&nbsp;simple country girl.” When reporters would ask Luca about Audrey Hepburn, he&nbsp;would say, “I&nbsp;don’t know who you’re talking about, you must be&nbsp;mistaken, my&nbsp;mother’s name is&nbsp;Dotti.” “I&nbsp;didn’t know she was Audrey Hepburn until&nbsp;I was 6&nbsp;years old,” Luca added.</p><p><h2>13. Caleb and Liv, children of&nbsp;Julianne Moore</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/203/23e/c98a9d58a6aca8e01fb06ec607.jpg><p>Julianne Moore <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>expressed</a> that her children, Caleb and Liv, never thought their mother was so&nbsp;famous.</p><p>“A&nbsp;few years ago, when&nbsp;I won an&nbsp;award, they were at&nbsp;one of&nbsp;those film clubs. They had seen one or&nbsp;2&nbsp;of&nbsp;my&nbsp;films, but they didn’t know about all of&nbsp;them&nbsp;— so&nbsp;they came to&nbsp;me, amazed and shocked. First, they were shocked that&nbsp;I had made so&nbsp;many movies, and then because&nbsp;I was doing scandalous scenes,” Moore added.</p><p><h2>14. Hazel, daughter of&nbsp;Emily Blunt and John Krasinski</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c53/eb0/bb18925fcd96a9352b6d9415a9.jpg><p>Emily Blunt <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>shared</a> that she and her husband, John Krasinski, never used the word “famous” in&nbsp;their home so&nbsp;their daughters would remain oblivious to&nbsp;the fame. One day their oldest daughter, Hazel, came up&nbsp;to&nbsp;mom and asked, “Are you famous?”</p><p>Emily assumed someone at&nbsp;school had told her, and asked her, but the girl lost interest on&nbsp;the spot and said no&nbsp;more. “What I&nbsp;don’t want is&nbsp;for my&nbsp;daughters to&nbsp;feel important or&nbsp;special or&nbsp;for there to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the slightest glimmer of&nbsp;them feeling different from other kids. If&nbsp;they can ignore the fame for as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;possible, that would make me&nbsp;happy,” added Blunt.</p><p><h2>15. Rumer, daughter of&nbsp;Bruce Willis and Demi Moore</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a0/92c/aacfda5dc18220ce1d22543c8c.jpg><p>Rumer Willis is&nbsp;the eldest daughter of&nbsp;actors Bruce Willis and Demi Moore. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>mentioned</a> that she didn’t understand how famous her parents were. “We&nbsp;would go&nbsp;to&nbsp;Disneyland and people would come up&nbsp;and try to&nbsp;get their picture taken and&nbsp;I didn’t understand,” Rumer said.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about these celebrities hiding their fame from their children for as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;possible?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4xqbGablaGyo77IraCeq12gtqW%2FjJ%2BmrqaUYry2wIytn56homK9or7Ep6usZaeav6Z506uspbFdm66uu9SsZHFoY2d9dns%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-15-celebrities-kids-found-out-their-parents-were-truly-famous-803205.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-15-celebrities-kids-found-out-their-parents-were-truly-famous-803205.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-15-celebrities-kids-found-out-their-parents-were-truly-famous-803205.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-15-celebrities-kids-found-out-their-parents-were-truly-famous-803205.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-15-celebrities-kids-found-out-their-parents-were-truly-famous-803205.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-15-celebrities-kids-found-out-their-parents-were-truly-famous-803205.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./17873-how-many-dates-should-you-wait-having-sex-someone.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./17873-how-many-dates-should-you-wait-having-sex-someone.html>How many dates should you wait before having sex with someone?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./halloween-candy-by-the-numbers.html>Halloween Candy by the Numbers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./halloween-candy-by-the-numbers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
