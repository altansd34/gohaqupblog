Holding her hand</h3><p class=align-left>Most ladies love some PDA, and holding hands will turn her on. While at it, rub your thumb against her hand and make her feel closer to you.</p><h3>3. Saying “I love you”</h3><p class=align-left>There is something about females and words that turns them on. Saying “I love you” is a turn-on for any lady, especially if you want a <a href=#>romantic relationship</a>. It might not seem like a big deal, especially if you are always saying it, but it’s still <a href=#>music</a> to her ears.</p><h3>4.

Getting her a personalized gift or a gift that honours something about her is magical.</p><h3>5. Touching her knee</h3><p class=align-left>Touch is one way to feel close to someone, and it can be a major turn-on for her. It shows her that you want physical contact innocently.</p><h3>6. That musky, clean manly scent</h3><p class=align-left>Smelling good is one of the major turn-ons for women. It doesn’t have to be a particular scent and can be your mouthwash or your aftershave. If you smell good and are clean, that is an instant turn-on to a woman.</p><h3>7. A sense of humour</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/65b51ac180d162ca.png><p class=align-left>A few laugh-out-loud moments will transform a plain man into the man of her dreams.

Shower her with compliments</h3><p class=align-left>Girls feel good when acknowledged and given genuine compliments about their good qualities. Compliments help to build a woman’s esteem. Make sure you give her a wink; she’ll appreciate every word.</p><h3>9. Warm hugs</h3><p class=align-left>A hug can be a turn-on, depending on how warm it is. When you hug your crush, let it linger a few seconds longer and let her feel your warmth. She will feel comfortable with your touch, and she’ll be warm all over as well.</p><h3>10. Deep conversations</h3><p class=align-left>If you are wondering what turns girls on, a deep conversation is one thing. Girls are generally good conservationists than men. They like to talk about anything and everything. Therefore, if you can have a <a href=#>good conversation</a> with her, she will be turned on.</p><h3>11.

Have confidence</h3><p class=align-left>Confidence is one of the biggest turn-ons in a man. Every girl loves a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">confident man</a>, and it is different from cockiness. Don’t be shy to be yourself when you’re around her; she’ll love your company.</p><h3>13. Be a gentleman</h3><p class=align-left>People think being a gentleman only exists in movies, but ladies still get turned on by a man who is a gentleman. Simple things such as opening the door for her or pulling out her chair will make her <a href=#>love you</a>.</p><h3>14. Firm voice</h3><p class=align-left>It doesn’t matter if the man has a deep or really deep voice; speak with muscles in your voice. Girls are attracted to men who speak with their muscles as it sounds more confident.</p><h3>15. The alpha male</h3><p class=align-left>Women are attracted to alpha males. This guy leads the pack and is always in control of the situation. Alpha males attract ladies without even trying.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/570a663a1c9d5f4d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Great Nipsey Hussle's quotes about life, love, friends and respect</span></p></a><h3>16.

Putting your arms around her will make her feel you are ready to protect her and she will love you for it.</p><h3>17. Be honest with your feelings</h3><p class=align-left>One way to turn a woman on is to express your <a href=#>thoughts and feelings</a>. However, don’t just say this to get into her pants; she will know. Tell her only when you mean it, and you might win her heart.</p><h3>18. Remembering the small things</h3><p class=align-left>Women are turned on when you remember small things and surprise them. She will be turned on if you just remember her favourite candy from the store.</p><h3>19. Playing with her hair</h3><p class=align-left>If you want to be physical but unassumingly innocent, run your fingers through her hair. You can brush a stray strand behind her ear or even pretend to remove something from her hair.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3f791252cbd5209a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ quotes about moving on that will make you feel better</span></p></a><h3>20. Apologizing first</h3><p class=align-left>Girls are turned on by men who <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">apologize first</a> after a fight. Say you are sorry first and mean it. Women are "always right" and must win an argument if you want to keep her.</p><h3>21. Show her love</h3><p class=align-left>One of the major turn-ons for a woman is love. When she loves a man, her emotions are on the loose and just thinking about or being around him turns her on.</p><h3>22. Patience</h3><p class=align-left>It’s rare to find a patient man. However, when a man is patient and understanding, that is a turn-on for a lady.</p><h3>23. Faithfulness</h3><p class=align-left>Women love men who don’t flirt or make advances with other girls. As long as a woman knows he can be a faithful guy, she will fall for him.</p><h3>24. Thoughtfully planned dates</h3><p class=align-left>A man who is thoughtful and able to plan a <a href=#>fun date </a>is a major turn-on to a woman. This is because it is not common for men to plan things like ladies do.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a5b1250c090bf4e4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wondering what boys want in girls?

Kissing on the lips is great, but a kiss on her forehead is amazing. This will make her feel not just loved but adored.</p><h3>27. Helping her put on jewellery</h3><p class=align-left>Once in a while, help her put on her jewellery when dressing up. It is not about the jewellery, but the act of helping her put it on is an incredibly romantic thing. This can lead to a kiss; who knows?</p><h3>28.

Go the extra mile and bring the coffee to bed, and she'll be smitten.</p><h3>31. Bonding with her friends and loved ones</h3><p class=align-left>If you want your woman to like you, even more, try to get along with her friends and family. She will know you are interested in more than one part of her life.</p><h3>32. Ask her for a dance</h3><p class=align-left>Dancing is a great way to get close to her innocently. Hold her in your arms when you dance and take charge of the motion passionately.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7f81fb1c40ffe493.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Exciting Marilyn Monroe quotes you should know about</span></p></a><h3>33.
