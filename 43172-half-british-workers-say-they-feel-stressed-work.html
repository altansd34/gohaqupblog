Health and Safety Executive <a href=#>statistics</a> show that work-related stress, depression or anxiety represented 50% of all work-related illness in 2020-21, with incidences rising significantly over the last 20 years.</p><p>YouGov research shows half of workers in Britain (52%) say they feel “very” or “fairly” stressed at work. A further 36% say they do not feel very stressed, with just 10% saying they don’t feel stressed at all while working.</p><p>Almost four in ten workers (39%) also say they feel stressed when they think about work outside of work hours. Three in 10 (31%) say they feel very or fairly stressed even when they’re not working and not thinking about work.</p><p>Between 53% and 58% of workers in the under-60 age groups say they feel stressed at work, compared to just 34% of workers in the 60+ age group. Workers under 30 are most likely to report feeling stressed when thinking about work outside of work hours (47%) compared to just 23% of workers aged 60 and older.</p><p>And while 35% of workers under 30 say they feel stressed outside of work, compared to 21% of workers in their 60s and older, this difference (14 points) is less stark.</p><h3>How does work life impact life outside of work?</h3><p>Half of workers (50%) say they spend a lot of time, or a fair amount of time, thinking about work outside of working hours, with 47% saying they spend not much or no time at all. Overall, nearly nine in 10 workers (88%) say they think about work outside of working hours.</p><p>Britons with stressful jobs also tend to have work on their mind a lot more than those who feel relaxed at their workplace. Two-thirds of those who say they feel stressed at work (66%) spend a lot or a fair amount of time thinking about their job outside of working hours, compared to a third (34%) of those who say they don’t feel stressed.</p><p>On the question of whether work life has a positive or negative impact (or no impact at all), workers are split. A third (33%) say their work life has a negative impact on their life outside of work, while a further third (34%) say a positive impact and 26% say it has no impact at all.</p><p>Part-time workers (working up to 29 hours a week) are more likely than full-time workers to say their work life has a positive impact on their lives outside of work, by 45% to 30%, while full-timers are more likely than part-timers to say their work negatively impacts their life, by 36% to 23%.</p><h3>Do Britons work too much?</h3><p>More workers in Britain work unpaid overtime (49%) than work paid overtime (42%).</p><p>Three in 10 (29%) say they work unpaid overtime at least once a week, including one in nine (11%) who say they work unpaid overtime every working day. Paid overtime is less frequent – 13% say they work paid overtime at least once a week.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/overtime-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>More than half of workers (56%) say their friends and family have asked them to cut back on how much they work, including one in five (20%) who say this happens very or fairly frequently. Four in 10 workers (41%) say they have never been asked by loved ones to cut back on their hours.</p><p>Workers in ABC1 households are more likely than those in C2DE households to say that their family and friends have asked them to cut back on work, by 61% to 48%.</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsY2aEc3nHmqOfZZKntrW10qFksKeioLKzv4ysmLJlpJ2yunnFnpylZaOpv6a%2F0p6bZq%2Bfp7g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f43172-half-british-workers-say-they-feel-stressed-work.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f43172-half-british-workers-say-they-feel-stressed-work.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f43172-half-british-workers-say-they-feel-stressed-work.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f43172-half-british-workers-say-they-feel-stressed-work.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f43172-half-british-workers-say-they-feel-stressed-work.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f43172-half-british-workers-say-they-feel-stressed-work.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-much-money-does-dannii-minogue-make-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-much-money-does-dannii-minogue-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Dannii Minogue Make?
