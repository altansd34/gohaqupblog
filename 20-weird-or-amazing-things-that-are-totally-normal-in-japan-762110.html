<time>07 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The norm in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Japan data-link=tag>Japan</a> can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprise everywhere else. For example, all elementary school students in&nbsp;Japan are expected to&nbsp;use <a href=#>randoseru</a>, firm-sided backpacks that usually cost at&nbsp;least around $300 each for about 6&nbsp;years. Essentially, these expensive backpacks are not meant for those who could buy them with their own money.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>delves into the Japanese culture to&nbsp;see how some things that are seen as&nbsp;common knowledge to&nbsp;the Japanese, might come as&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprise to&nbsp;those who were not raised in&nbsp;Japan.</p><p><h2>1. Drainage canals in&nbsp;Japan are so&nbsp;clean, some even have koi fish in&nbsp;them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/111/e61/0f12a553ee9cf4a8bd6536480c.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;well-known fact that Japan is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very clean country. But koi fish living in&nbsp;the drainage canals puts the Japanese cleanliness level so&nbsp;far up&nbsp;the charts. Not only do&nbsp;koi require <a href=#>clean water</a> to&nbsp;live&nbsp;in, they can cost a&nbsp;bomb, so&nbsp;the fact that Japan believes that the water can be&nbsp;kept clean and the fish are unlikely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;snagged away is&nbsp;simply mind-blowing.</p><p><h2>2. “Will you wash my&nbsp;underwear?” is&nbsp;a&nbsp;marriage proposal.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/286/48a/b170765857b7bb6c896117e2e5.jpg><p>To&nbsp;some of&nbsp;us, <a href=#>this</a> might come off as&nbsp;insulting, but to&nbsp;the Japanese, this means that the man trusts the woman enough to&nbsp;wash one of&nbsp;his most private possessions. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;humbling way to&nbsp;invite someone to&nbsp;see even the not so&nbsp;pretty part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person and welcome them to&nbsp;help fix&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>3. A&nbsp;small face is&nbsp;considered beautiful.</h2></p><p>It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;confusing in&nbsp;Western culture if&nbsp;you were told that you have a&nbsp;small face. On&nbsp;a&nbsp;Japanese <a href=#>show</a>, where <a href=# title=Madonna data-link=tag>Madonna</a> made an&nbsp;appearance, the host commented to&nbsp;her that her face was small and she had a&nbsp;look of&nbsp;confusion before replying, “But I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;big heart!” This hinted that she might have thought he&nbsp;was saying something unfavorable, when he&nbsp;was actually praising her for her beauty.</p><p><h2>4. Some people require more clothing during the summer.</h2></p><p>Summer in&nbsp;Japan can be&nbsp;very hot, especially in&nbsp;Osaka and Kyoto, but that does not deter some Japanese ladies from donning <a href=#>more clothing</a> to&nbsp;protect their skin from the sun’s rays. In&nbsp;most other countries, when summer comes, it’s time for breezy summer dresses, but Japanese ladies prefer not to&nbsp;risk skin cancer or&nbsp;getting a&nbsp;tan.</p><p><h2>5. Sunglasses are typically only worn by&nbsp;celebrities.</h2></p><p>Even when sunlight gets into their eyes, the Japanese would prefer to&nbsp;use an&nbsp;umbrella than to&nbsp;wear sunglasses. This fashionable item is&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;something that <a href=#>only</a> very stylish people, celebrities, and foreigners wear.</p><p><h2>6. When eating ramen or&nbsp;soba, the noodles should be&nbsp;slurped.</h2></p><p>Even though the Japanese are generally a&nbsp;quiet culture, they believe in&nbsp;slurping while eating noodles. The justification is&nbsp;that slurping cools off hot noodles as&nbsp;they come into full direct contact with your tongue. This way, you can enjoy them while the rest of&nbsp;the bowl stays piping hot. Some also believe that slurping is&nbsp;a&nbsp;better way to&nbsp;<a href=#>savor</a> the aroma of&nbsp;the soba.</p><p><h2>7. The pinky finger and the red thread</h2></p><p>Just like in&nbsp;the Chinese and Korean culture, the Japanese believe that the gods tie an&nbsp;invisible red cord around the fingers of&nbsp;those that are destined for each other. The thread may stretch or&nbsp;tangle, but it&nbsp;never breaks. As&nbsp;for the pinky, if&nbsp;a&nbsp;Japanese person asks, “Is&nbsp;she your...” and gestures with their pinky, it&nbsp;<a href=#>signifies</a> “girlfriend,” “mistress,” or&nbsp;“wife.” Unless you’re talking to&nbsp;a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia, in&nbsp;which case it&nbsp;means that the mistress, girlfriend, or&nbsp;wife has been decapitated.</p><p><h2>8. “Would you make miso soup for me&nbsp;every day?” is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;marriage proposal.</h2></p><p>You might think, “Is&nbsp;he&nbsp;looking for an&nbsp;in-house cook?” but this is&nbsp;an&nbsp;indirect way of&nbsp;<a href=#>proposing</a>. The Japanese drink miso soup every day, but each house has their own preference on&nbsp;how they like their miso soup. This proposal means that the person is&nbsp;being trusted with one of&nbsp;the most important parts of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Japanese person’s everyday meal.</p><p><h2>9. Lawyers wear a&nbsp;special gold badge.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;other countries, lawyers might only have business cards to&nbsp;show that they are qualified, but in&nbsp;countries like Japan and Korea, lawyers have special <a href=#>badges</a> that they wear on&nbsp;the lapel of&nbsp;their blazers. The sunflower badge is&nbsp;initially shiny gold but wear and tear would reveal the silver badge underneath, as&nbsp;can be&nbsp;seen on&nbsp;badges of&nbsp;veteran lawyers, unless these lawyers paid extra for real gold badges.</p><p><h2>10. There are hardly any trash cans, but it’s so&nbsp;clean there.</h2></p><p>Tourists may be&nbsp;baffled by&nbsp;the fact that there are not many <a href=#>trash cans</a> around for such a&nbsp;clean country. Trash cans are generally available near vending machines. Some trash cans outside of&nbsp;stores can only be&nbsp;used by&nbsp;the store. The Japanese have a&nbsp;habit of&nbsp;cleaning up&nbsp;after themselves and usually hold on&nbsp;to&nbsp;their trash until they get home where they can throw the trash away properly.</p><p><h2>11. Girls and boys almost always have bangs and brown hair.</h2></p><p>Bangs or&nbsp;mae-gami is&nbsp;often seen adorning young Japanese faces. Perhaps this is&nbsp;due to&nbsp;their culture of&nbsp;favoring <a href=#>cuteness</a> and viewing small faces as&nbsp;beautiful. Although most Japanese were born with natural black hair, young people tend to&nbsp;dye their hair brown, a&nbsp;trend they call chapatsu which literally means “tea hair.”</p><p><h2>12. Raw egg is&nbsp;pretty common in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Japanese meal.</h2></p><p>People always ask, do&nbsp;the Japanese really eat raw eggs? The answer is&nbsp;<a href=#>yes</a>. Raw eggs and lightly cooked eggs are usually eaten with <a href=# title=rice data-link=tag>rice</a>, meat, or&nbsp;soup-based noodles. The easiest meal is&nbsp;where a&nbsp;raw egg is&nbsp;mixed with rice, soy sauce, and seaweed or&nbsp;furikake (a&nbsp;dried Japanese seasoning) is&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;bachelor’s food because of&nbsp;how easy it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;make and eat alone.</p><p><h2>13. A&nbsp;long-sleeved kimono is&nbsp;only for unmarried young women.</h2></p><p>Furisode or&nbsp;long-sleeved kimono is&nbsp;only worn by&nbsp;<a href=#>unmarried</a> young women. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;commonly rented or&nbsp;bought by&nbsp;parents for their daughters to&nbsp;wear when celebrating Coming of&nbsp;Age Day, the year they turn&nbsp;20, the legal age in&nbsp;Japan. On&nbsp;top of&nbsp;the huge belt holding the kimono, some wear an&nbsp;attractive cloth that peeks out of&nbsp;the belt. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;improper for married women to&nbsp;have this cloth showing because it&nbsp;is&nbsp;akin to&nbsp;a&nbsp;desire to&nbsp;attract other men.</p><p><h2>14. They soak in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bath after rinsing first.</h2></p><p>Taking a&nbsp;soak in&nbsp;the bath in&nbsp;an&nbsp;ordinary life of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Japanese person is&nbsp;really just that&nbsp;— there should not be&nbsp;bath bombs or&nbsp;bubble soap used. The Japanese would always <a href=#>rinse</a> their body outside the bath tub in&nbsp;the shower or&nbsp;a&nbsp;washbowl before entering the bath. After soaking, they would soap their body outside the tub and rinse before the second soak. The bath would have been prepared beforehand to&nbsp;ensure the right temperature and is&nbsp;usually shared among family members.</p><p><h2>15. Blush should be&nbsp;more pronounced than eye shadow and lipstick in&nbsp;Japanese makeup.</h2></p><p>Japanese women tend to&nbsp;go&nbsp;for more soft-colored lips instead of&nbsp;strong or&nbsp;dark-colored hues. However, they like to&nbsp;amp up&nbsp;their <a href=#>blush</a> because it&nbsp;gives them a&nbsp;look of&nbsp;vitality, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they’ve just exercised and look fresh, but without the sweat.</p><p><h2>16. Christmas is&nbsp;like Valentine’s Day and it’s a&nbsp;tradition to&nbsp;eat at&nbsp;KFC.</h2></p><p>People in&nbsp;most other countries celebrate <a href=# title=Christmas data-link=tag>Christmas</a> with their family, but to&nbsp;the Japanese this is&nbsp;another event like Valentine’s Day. There was a&nbsp;time when hotels were fully booked on&nbsp;Christmas Eve because couples would spend the night together. Another Christmas tradition is&nbsp;<a href=#>eating Kentucky Fried Chicken</a>, because KFC Japan has promoted their fried chicken as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Christmas meal since December of&nbsp;1974.</p><p><h2>17. They visit shrines, churches, and temples on&nbsp;different occasions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/15b/7bf/38504053a4bf33b9e0ed38ea11.jpg><p>Throughout the typical life of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Japanese person, they go&nbsp;to&nbsp;3&nbsp;different religious places for different occasions. To&nbsp;celebrate Shichi-Go-San, a&nbsp;festival for 3-, 5- and 7-year-old kids, the Japanese would visit a&nbsp;shrine. Weddings are typically done in&nbsp;churches, sometimes in&nbsp;<a href=#>faux churches</a> that were built for the sole purpose of&nbsp;holding wedding ceremonies. Funerals are often held in&nbsp;temples.</p><p><h2>18. Blood type is&nbsp;used instead of&nbsp;horoscope.</h2></p><p>While in&nbsp;other countries people would only ask for your <a href=#>blood type</a> for medical purposes, in&nbsp;Japan, blood type is&nbsp;more popularly used to&nbsp;gauge a&nbsp;person’s <a href=# title=personality data-link=tag>personality</a> traits than horoscopes. Blood type&nbsp;A, which represents most of&nbsp;the Japanese population is&nbsp;said to&nbsp;be&nbsp;well-organized and shy. Blood type&nbsp;O is&nbsp;optimistic and ambitious. The rare blood type&nbsp;AB is&nbsp;eccentric. Blood type&nbsp;B has been branded as&nbsp;selfish, and might not be&nbsp;very favorable in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Japanese person’s eyes.</p><p><h2>19. Hot towels at&nbsp;restaurants should be&nbsp;used before eating.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;high-class Japanese restaurants, the hot towel or&nbsp;oshibori is&nbsp;provided for their customers. In&nbsp;cheaper restaurants, they usually come in&nbsp;plastic. Unlike napkins, which are used to&nbsp;wipe the mouth after eating, they are meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used before eating to&nbsp;<a href=#>clean your hands</a>. Cleaning your face or&nbsp;neck with them is&nbsp;considered poor manners.</p><p><h2>20. They say the same thing to&nbsp;mean “yes” and “no.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/58c/55b/0984ba53168168eb43286993ac.jpg><p>The word for yes is&nbsp;hai and for no&nbsp;is&nbsp;iie. But the Japanese also often use “ii&nbsp;desu” or&nbsp;“kekkou desu” which can mean either yes or&nbsp;<a href=#>no</a>. How do&nbsp;you know which one is&nbsp;it? You have to&nbsp;pay attention to&nbsp;the context and the way it&nbsp;is&nbsp;being said. The intonation and/or gesture will dictate what the speaker means.</p><p>Which points above make you feel like living in&nbsp;Japan and adapting to&nbsp;their culture? Are you aware of&nbsp;any other interesting things about the Japanese culture?</p><p>Illustrated by Ekaterina Gapanovich for Bright Side</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH9xedaeoKucXaS%2Fbq3MmrGippdiwam1zaCqZqyYlsFurdGeZK2npJa5rcWMp6arpZGheqq6jKOYqZmeYoR3fpBqZ2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f20-weird-or-amazing-things-that-are-totally-normal-in-japan-762110.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f20-weird-or-amazing-things-that-are-totally-normal-in-japan-762110.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f20-weird-or-amazing-things-that-are-totally-normal-in-japan-762110.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f20-weird-or-amazing-things-that-are-totally-normal-in-japan-762110.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20-weird-or-amazing-things-that-are-totally-normal-in-japan-762110.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20-weird-or-amazing-things-that-are-totally-normal-in-japan-762110.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./20-things-that-were-one-mans-trash-but-became-another-mans-treasure-797265.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./20-things-that-were-one-mans-trash-but-became-another-mans-treasure-797265.html>20+ Things That Were One Mans Trash, but Became Another Mans Treasure</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./16-celebrity-moms-who-exposed-the-truth-about-postpartum-life-812858.html>16 Celebrity Moms Who Exposed the Truth About Postpartum Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./16-celebrity-moms-who-exposed-the-truth-about-postpartum-life-812858.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
