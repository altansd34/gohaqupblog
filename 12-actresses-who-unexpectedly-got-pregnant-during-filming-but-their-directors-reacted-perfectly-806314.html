<time>19 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Making a&nbsp;movie is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;fast process. And working on&nbsp;a&nbsp;series with many seasons and episodes can stretch to&nbsp;10+&nbsp;years. At&nbsp;the same time, life goes on&nbsp;and stars can get married or&nbsp;have kids within this period. However, confessing their <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a> to&nbsp;colleagues and on-set bosses is&nbsp;always a&nbsp;big stress for actresses. All because it&nbsp;might not fit into the script and in&nbsp;this case, the celebrity risks losing her job.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> recalled stories from when movie and series makers found a&nbsp;perfect way out when they learned about the unexpected pregnancy of&nbsp;a&nbsp;main actress.</p><p><h2><i>The X-Files</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/03a/935/d3a73e5be3b21421c9bb470bd0.jpg><p>While filming the second season of&nbsp;<i>The X-Files, </i>Gillian Anderson’s growing baby bump was first concealed by&nbsp;special angles and oversized clothes. But when it&nbsp;was time for the actress to&nbsp;give birth to&nbsp;the baby, <strong>scriptwriters created Dana Scully’s abduction by&nbsp;aliens</strong>. This explained her absence and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>made</a> it&nbsp;possible for the actress to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;short maternity leave. The scenes of&nbsp;the alien ship even showed the big baby bump of&nbsp;the heroine.</p><p>Gillian Anderson got back to&nbsp;filming several days after giving birth to&nbsp;her daughter. That’s why in&nbsp;the 8th episode, Scully <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>doesn’t get up</a>&nbsp;from a&nbsp;hospital cot where she was returned according to&nbsp;the plot. By&nbsp;the way, the consequences of&nbsp;this abduction created the basis for several plot turns. Thus, in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the episodes of&nbsp;the 5th season, Dana Scully finds out that she had given birth to&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby then.</p><p><h2><i>The Big Bang Theory</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f04/bb6/a2109959b1aa944b4aaa166cfb.jpg><p>While filming the 11th season of&nbsp;the popular sitcom, the actress who played Bernadette was pregnant. It&nbsp;became a&nbsp;real <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>challenge</a> for the showrunners because in&nbsp;the previous season<strong> the character and her husband had already had one kid</strong>. Nevertheless, the creators of&nbsp;the series decided that it&nbsp;could become a&nbsp;truly interesting story. Howard, Bernadette’s husband, was shocked to&nbsp;find out that she was expecting a&nbsp;second baby so&nbsp;soon after the birth of&nbsp;the first one (who had not turned a&nbsp;year old yet).</p><p>“They’re shell-shocked at&nbsp;the beginning,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> the creator of&nbsp;the series. “They’re still coming to&nbsp;terms with having a&nbsp;first child in&nbsp;the house, so&nbsp;having a&nbsp;second child has really knocked them for a&nbsp;loop. Some of&nbsp;the same things from the first time around too, like Bernadette, who is&nbsp;very driven at&nbsp;work and took some time off to&nbsp;have the first baby and has just gotten back, is&nbsp;now going to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;take time off again. You start to&nbsp;see her starting to&nbsp;feel threatened and vulnerable in&nbsp;her career.”</p><p><h2><i>Once Upon a&nbsp;Time</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c3/415/81e32b5af08165864b33725e63.jpg><p>Actress Ginnifer Goodwin, who played the role of&nbsp;Snow White, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> her pregnancy while filming the 3rd season of&nbsp;the series. But showrunners quickly found a&nbsp;way out. This is&nbsp;how Snow White and Prince Charming had a&nbsp;baby.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, the fact that the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a> her future husband and the father of&nbsp;the baby on&nbsp;the set makes it&nbsp;seem even more like a&nbsp;fairy tale. And the father was the actor who plays Prince Charming.</p><p><h2><i>Desperate Housewives</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e46/b0f/f1ed8d5efd893d3c7a1826ec8a.jpg><p>Actress Marcia Cross got pregnant with twins when she was 44. It&nbsp;came as&nbsp;a&nbsp;big surprise because a&nbsp;pregnancy for her character, Bree, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was not</a> in&nbsp;keeping with the series&nbsp;— all of&nbsp;the plot lines had already been prepared beforehand. That’s why the series creators had to&nbsp;search for a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;conceal her growing baby bump. Thus, Bree started to&nbsp;wear more sweaters and do&nbsp;close-up shots only. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the episodes,<strong> they even used a&nbsp;gingerbread house to&nbsp;hide her tummy</strong>.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, after childbirth, Marcia Cross had to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>play</a> a&nbsp;pregnant woman in&nbsp;the series&nbsp;— her character was putting a&nbsp;pillow under her clothes to&nbsp;later pretend that the baby her daughter was going to&nbsp;have was hers.</p><p><h2><i>Alias</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b5/ac6/3aa5455c5691c961206f173dd5.jpg><p>Having learned about <a href=# title="Jennifer Garner" data-link=tag>Jennifer Garner</a>’s pregnancy, as&nbsp;she was playing the main role, scriptwriters had to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rewrite</a> season 5&nbsp;completely. Now, Sydney Bristow was also getting ready to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mother, that’s why they didn’t have to&nbsp;hide the growing baby bump.</p><p>However, in&nbsp;late pregnancy, the actress could no&nbsp;longer participate in&nbsp;complex action scenes<strong>. That’s why they added Rachael to&nbsp;the script&nbsp;— a&nbsp;young special agent, and Sydney became her supervisor.</strong> This way, Rachael could enjoy many breathtaking adventures, while Sydney could enjoy her pregnancy in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relatively calm atmosphere.</p><p><h2><i>The Witches</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/08e/462/2267645403a010980ca02fb238.jpg><p><a href=# title="Anne Hathaway" data-link=tag>Anne Hathaway</a> got pregnant while working on&nbsp;this movie. After having learned about the wardrobe was being prepared for the Grand High Witch, Hathaway <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>protested</a>, explaining that she would feel constrained if&nbsp;something was too fitted in&nbsp;the waist area. That’s why they made the decision<strong> to&nbsp;not use costumes with waistlines that were too thin,</strong> much to&nbsp;the costume designer’s dismay. Eventually, it&nbsp;was decided to&nbsp;opt for more loose clothing.</p><p>The biggest issue from the perspective of&nbsp;the wardrobe was the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>purple</a> dress with the golden snake. The actress’s pregnancy was already noticeable, and that’s why its design required a&nbsp;thorough work-over.</p><p><h2><i>Bones</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/877/0a3/3d4307561a84d28abe2294dc08.jpg><p>The star of&nbsp;the series <i><a href=# title=Bones data-link=tag>Bones</a>, </i>Emily Deschanel, and her alter-ego Temperance Brennan were pregnant in&nbsp;the first half of&nbsp;Season&nbsp;7. However, the actress gave birth to&nbsp;her baby a&nbsp;bit earlier than her characters. That’s why <strong>Deschanel </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>had to</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;put on&nbsp;an&nbsp;artificial tummy after childbirth to&nbsp;film one episode.</strong> The actress confessed that it&nbsp;was very inconvenient and hot to&nbsp;walk around wearing&nbsp;it.</p><p>In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;choose the most suitable one, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tried on</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;tummies that were created for different celebs. Among them, Emily tried on&nbsp;the belly bump of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Nicole Kidman" data-link=tag>Nicole Kidman</a>, however she claims that she doesn’t remember which bump she eventually selected.</p><p><h2><i>The Office</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/686/58e/2a24e956f3bd6e3d7b9dcb25ff.jpg><p>When the actress who played the main role of&nbsp;Pam, Jenna Fischer, was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pregnant</a> with her first child, she and her on-set husband already had one child according to&nbsp;the script. So&nbsp;the actress was afraid to&nbsp;talk about her delicate situation and asked the costume designers to&nbsp;buy new clothes that could hide her baby bump from prying eyes. However, when it&nbsp;was no&nbsp;longer possible to&nbsp;hide&nbsp;it, Jenna confessed everything, and it&nbsp;was decided that she would fit her pregnancy into the series naturally&nbsp;— by&nbsp;giving the couple a&nbsp;second child.</p><p><h2><i>The Vampire Diaries</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/85f/cf1/81851357258c3ecaa5fed90e8d.jpg><p>In&nbsp;season&nbsp;7, the vampire Caroline, played by&nbsp;Candice King, got pregnant... with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;magical transition. She became a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>surrogate mother</a> for unborn twins. According to&nbsp;the producer of&nbsp;the series, they created a&nbsp;story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman who knocked on&nbsp;the door of&nbsp;a&nbsp;grieving widower saying, “I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;am pregnant with your kids.” But it&nbsp;was obvious that this plot twist was too sharp, that’s why it&nbsp;was not there in&nbsp;the plan initially... until the moment Candice King called and said she was pregnant.</p><p>Despite the real <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pregnancy</a>, the actress had to&nbsp;wear an&nbsp;artificial tummy over her own. The thing&nbsp;is, her character was pregnant with twins,<strong> while Candice was expecting only one baby and didn’t look “pregnant enough.”</strong> Apart from that, this unexpected plot twist <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gave birth</a> to&nbsp;spin-offs <i>The Originals</i> and <i>Legacies</i>.</p><p><h2><i>Jack Reacher</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ade/824/47c7b559ada237649216e72fc2.jpg><p>The thriller <i>Jack Reacher </i>is&nbsp;one case where it&nbsp;was decided to&nbsp;conceal an&nbsp;actress’s pregnancy from viewers. The situation was further <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>complicated</a> by&nbsp;the fact that the action in&nbsp;the movie lasted for only 3&nbsp;days, while filming lasted for 4&nbsp;months. That’s why costume designers and the cameramen had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;their best to&nbsp;make Rosamund Pike look the same in&nbsp;the frame and try to&nbsp;hide her rounded baby bump. For example, the actress often wore black in&nbsp;the frame.</p><p>But the actress herself <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>thinks</a> that the presence of&nbsp;several more pounds while filming only <strong>made the character more plausible, more human</strong>. “I&nbsp;actually really like the way I&nbsp;look, because I&nbsp;am carrying a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;weight,” said Rosamund Pike.</p><p><h2><i>Grey’s Anatomy</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d25/477/8b5e50568cb39f2a50fdbd90a6.jpg><p>Caterina Scorsone, who played the role of&nbsp;doctor Amelia Shepherd in&nbsp;<i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> and its spin-off Private Practice, <strong>was pregnant 3&nbsp;times while working on&nbsp;set</strong>. Her first and third pregnancies were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worked into</a> the script. However, according to&nbsp;the scenario, doctor Amelia Shepherd lost her first baby. That’s why, after learning about the actress’s other pregnancy, the series creators decided to&nbsp;give her character a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;happy mother.</p><p><h2><i>Mistresses</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/de2/c11/f73114519ea2699f9407c7e36d.jpg><p>The star of&nbsp;<i>Charmed, </i>Alyssa Milano, who played the role of&nbsp;Savannah Davis in&nbsp;<i>Mistresses</i>, got pregnant right before the beginning of&nbsp;filming of&nbsp;Season&nbsp;2. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>conceal</a>&nbsp;it, <strong>the actress was hidden behind bags and menus and asked to&nbsp;hold props</strong> like bulky bags and pillows in&nbsp;her hands. She also wore black oversized clothing.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>According</a> to&nbsp;Alyssa Milano, the series creators put so&nbsp;much effort into hiding her pregnancy that it&nbsp;looked like a&nbsp;sketch from Saturday Night Live.
