You might recognize the 62-year-old from the Police Academy movies or as the man that can make literally any sound using just his mouth. As a “voicetrumentalist,” Michael imitates hundreds of thousands of sound effects. His act is one that Simon Cowell absolutely loves.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-michael-winslow-auditions-for-america-s-got-talent-after-finding-success-with-police-academy>Michael Winslow Auditions for ‘America’s Got Talent’ After Finding Success with ‘Police Academy’</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Terry Crews</a> was very excited backstage when meeting Michael for the first time on America’s Got Talent. Michael has been making sounds with his mouth since he was little. He decided to hitchhike to Los Angeles after high school without having a clear game plan. Finally, Michael landed a role in Police Academy in 1984 which really changed his life forever. That same year, he was a part of the comedy horror film Gremlins.</p><p>Seven Police Academy movies later and a role in Mel Brooks’ 1987 film Spaceballs, Michael has become quite the on-screen legend. He’s also done GEICO commercials and voiceovers on Robot Chicken and Family Guy that make up some of his nearly 70 IMDb acting credits. He was even nominated for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in 1987. Though his acting roles were small here and there, his talent is massive.</p><p>Many were obviously wondering why he decided to audition for&nbsp;America’s Got Talent when his name first appeared on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the auditioning contestant’s list.</a> After raising his children, Michael is in a whole new phase of his life. Now is finally time for him to shine. He wants to show that world that he “still has something to offer” since paving the way for voiceover artists for more than 40 years.</p><p>“I stopped making movies because I quit the business for my children,” Michael said ahead of his audition. “I had to raise them because I became a widower.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-his-unique-audition-impresses-all-of-the-judges>His Unique Audition Impresses All of the Judges</h2><p>When Michael stepped out onto the stage for his America’s Got Talent audition, Cowell and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Howie Mandel</a> instantly recognized him. Cowell was totally geeking out about all of Michael’s acting roles and said he was “thrilled” that he came to audition. The judges all wanted to hear how he got started as a voicestrumentalist.</p><p>Growing up, Michael was an Air Force brat which led to his family moving every few years. It was hard for him to make friends so he decided to make his own using sounds. His routine actually mirrored growing up and being around planes all of the time. His parents gave him his first radio to keep him occupied. Michael of course learned how to perfectly replicate the sounds of the radio with his mouth.</p><p>“My son Britton said ‘This is America’s Got Talent, you can come out here and be anything you want instead of being forced to be something you don’t,'” Michael told the judges. “So this is the show you come to be yourself.”</p><p>Michael’s routine ended in an epic mic drop. The judges all gave him a standing ovation. Before the pandemic, Michael was going to attempt to break a Guinness World Record. His plans were put on the backburner. Even if he doesn’t win America’s Got Talent, this stage could be the perfect platform to re-launch his career.</p><p>“We were going to do a stand-up comedy show — fifty states in forty-nine days,” he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Medium</a>. We were going to do that, and then this hit, and now I have to wait another year before I try again.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-1097946086.jpg alt="Alicia Keys Gets Dragged Over Plot of New Netflix Movie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y56enqaUlr%2B6edWooJydXZawtbvRZqSim5iWsq151qKlrKSfrHqiwcOiq6Knnqh6p7vRZpimnaKesKK%2FjKCmrWWklrmmutNo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flegendary-voice-actor-michael-winslow-auditions-for-americas-got-talent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flegendary-voice-actor-michael-winslow-auditions-for-americas-got-talent.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flegendary-voice-actor-michael-winslow-auditions-for-americas-got-talent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flegendary-voice-actor-michael-winslow-auditions-for-americas-got-talent.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flegendary-voice-actor-michael-winslow-auditions-for-americas-got-talent.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flegendary-voice-actor-michael-winslow-auditions-for-americas-got-talent.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./murkowski-experiences-mid-campaign-approval-bump.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./murkowski-experiences-mid-campaign-approval-bump.html>Lisa Murkowski Experiences a Rarity for Senators: A Mid-Campaign Approval Bump</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./13428-late-night-lattes-will-extended-coffee-shop-openin.html>Late night lattes: Will extended coffee shop opening hours take off in the UK?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./13428-late-night-lattes-will-extended-coffee-shop-openin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
