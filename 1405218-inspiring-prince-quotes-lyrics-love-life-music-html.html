Some of these quotes are actually Prince quotes lyrics, and some are words that he said during interviews and such.</p><ul><li>Like books and black lives, albums still matter.</li><li>A strong spirit transcends rules.</li><li>Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called life.</li><li>Despite everything, no one can dictate who you are to other people.</li><li>Instead of hate, celebrate.</li><li>I don’t really care so much what people say about me because it usually is a reflection of who they are. For example, if people wish I would sound like I used to sound, then it says more about them than it does me.</li><li>I’ve grown up, everyone’s got to grow up. But there’s something inside me, I’m always going to have that little sort of – how do you say? – child streak.</li><li>To create something from nothing is one of the greatest feelings, and I would - I don't know, I wish it upon everybody. It's heaven.</li><li>It’s a hurtful place, the world, in and of itself. We don’t need to add to it. And we’re in a place now where we all need one another, and it’s going to get rougher.</li><li>Time is a mind construct. It's not real.</li><li>There are people who are unhappy with everything</li><li>Every day I feel is a blessing from God. And I consider it a new beginning. Yeah, everything is beautiful.</li><li>I've always understood the two to be intertwined: sexuality and spirituality. That never changed.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/570a663a1c9d5f4d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Great Nipsey Hussle's quotes about life, love, friends and respect</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/570a663a1c9d5f4d.jpg><ul><li>Everyone has a rock bottom.</li><li>I like constructive criticism from smart people.</li><li>When I found out that there was eight Presidents before George Washington, I wanted to smack somebody.</li><li>My fans bring their sons and daughters to my shows now. That’s how I grew up. I hope to be an inspiration to those people.</li><li>The music industry is a matrix that is counter to what is natural and right.</li><li>Technology is cool, but you've got to use it as opposed to letting it use you.</li><li>Art is about building a new foundation, not just laying something on top of what's already there.</li><li>I want to make heart decisions in business. If you can’t do that, you’re not free. I want to be able to dictate which way I’m going to go.</li><li>Cool means being able to hang with yourself. All you have to ask yourself is ‘Is there anybody I’m afraid of? Is there anybody who if I walked into a room and saw, I’d get nervous?’ If not, then you’re cool.</li><li>The key to longevity is to learn every aspect of music that you can.</li><li>There's a dark side to everything.</li><li>Everyone has their own experience. That’s why we are here, to go through our experience, to learn, to go down those paths and eventually you may have gone down so many paths and learned so much that you don’t have to come back again.</li><li>People say I'm wearing heels because I'm short.

I am not afraid of anything. I haven’t built any walls around myself, and I am just like anyone else. I need love and water.</li><li>If you lend your consciousness to someone else, you're a robot.</li><li>When you wake up, each day looks the same, so each day should be a new beginning. I don’t have an expiration date.</li><li>I don't live in the past. I don't play my old records for that reason. I make a statement, then move on to the next.</li><li>Sometimes it takes years for a person to become an overnight success.</li><li>I don't talk to old people; they try to find ways to stay static. Young folks are the ones with the ideas and constantly moving forward.</li><li>When you sit down to write something, there should be no guidelines. The main idea is not supposed to be, ‘How many different ways can we sell it?’ That’s so far away from the true spirit of what music is.</li><li>Anyway, all these computers and digital gadgets are no good. They just fill your head with numbers and that can't be good for you.</li><li>No one can come and claim ownership of my work.

Take a look:</p><ul><li>When I first started out in this music industry, I was most concerned with freedom. Freedom to produce, freedom to play all the instruments on my records, freedom to say anything I wanted to.</li><li>My mother told me one day I walked in to her and said, 'Mom, I'm not going to be sick anymore,' and she said 'Why?' and I said 'Because an angel told me so.' Now, I don't remember saying it; that's just what she told me.</li><li>I'm not entangled in a bunch of lawsuits and a web that I can't get out of. I can hold my head up... a happily married man who has his head in order. There isn't a bunch of scandal in my life.</li><li>People speculate on your personal life all the time anyway. So I just think it's important to keep my private life private and my public persona more into music, you know?</li><li>I had a massive ego [at youth]. Massive. But that’s not such a bad thing. Because at least you’re aspiring to be something, you consider yourself great because you want to be great.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e10ed371c1a39f91.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Memorable Beauty and the Beast quotes from the iconic Disney film</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Now, let’s have a look at some awesome Prince quotes from songs.</p><h2>Famous Prince lyrics quotes</h2><p class=align-left>Here are some cool Prince famous lyrics that will, undoubtedly, make you listen to these songs again and again.
