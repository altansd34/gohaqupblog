<time>19 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Well, what do&nbsp;you think? The biggest log cabin in&nbsp;the world was truly magnificent! Known as&nbsp;the Forestry Building, it&nbsp;was enormous, at&nbsp;over 200 feet long and more than 70&nbsp;feet high. It&nbsp;was built in&nbsp;1905 in&nbsp;Portland, Oregon, the United States.</p><p>And Portland was known for its flourishing wheat and flour industry, a&nbsp;growing shipping port, and timber industry at&nbsp;that time. This log cabin was a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the big exposition held in&nbsp;Portland. It&nbsp;took 2&nbsp;years to&nbsp;build&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c39/3b4/74ed645e9293037300ae71d252.png><p>The Forestry Building was constructed out of&nbsp;whole logs. Even the bark was still in&nbsp;place! The interior of&nbsp;the cabin held 54&nbsp;giant, unpeeled logs, and some of&nbsp;them were 6&nbsp;feet across. These logs supported a&nbsp;2-story center aisle, lit by&nbsp;skylights. It&nbsp;was designed in&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cross. And then, one night, almost 60&nbsp;years later, one of&nbsp;the neighbors sensed smoke. He&nbsp;looked outside. Fire! The Forestry Building was quickly disappearing in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;his eyes!</p><p>The fire crew came only 15&nbsp;minutes after the fire started, but despite all their efforts, they couldn’t save the cabin. The flames were enormous, nearly ten stories high! The fire was so&nbsp;strong it&nbsp;illuminated the sky for miles, giving the whole neighborhood an&nbsp;orange glow. The windows were popping out because of&nbsp;the heat. Glass was falling down and ashes the size of&nbsp;giant snowflakes were falling to&nbsp;the ground within a&nbsp;mile of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cabin. The Forestry Building was gone in&nbsp;only 2&nbsp;hours. The fire eruption happened because of&nbsp;bad electrical wiring from the time the cabin was built.</p><p>There are more awesome timber structures&nbsp;— for example, check out The Great Eastern Temple in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Japan data-link=tag>Japan</a>, from the early 8th century. It’s even a&nbsp;UNESCO World Heritage Site today! It&nbsp;was incredibly hard to&nbsp;build&nbsp;it. Construction work took the team a&nbsp;long time to&nbsp;build the structure because of&nbsp;several fires and strong earthquakes. The project was so&nbsp;big and maybe even too ambitious because it&nbsp;almost bankrupted the Japanese economy back then. The Great Eastern Temple required large imports of&nbsp;gold, and it&nbsp;used up&nbsp;almost all of&nbsp;the bronze reserves in&nbsp;Japan. It’s been standing powerful and strong for centuries but still had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through so&nbsp;many reconstructions and setbacks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d23/363/2ee8215faab63f90e8178ae2c5.png><p>One of&nbsp;the biggest wooden structures human hands ever put together was built in&nbsp;New Mexico. It’s called Atlas, and it&nbsp;was created of&nbsp;a&nbsp;12-story-high, 1,000-foot long structure. It&nbsp;was made using laminate, glue, and fiberglass pegs. It&nbsp;was created to&nbsp;test the electromagnetic pulse resistance of&nbsp;flying aircraft. It&nbsp;produced an&nbsp;actual EMP which was never practiced before. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;big investment&nbsp;— $60 million&nbsp;— but it&nbsp;operated for a&nbsp;little bit more than a&nbsp;decade.</p><p>During that period as&nbsp;the technology was developing, computer simulations ended up&nbsp;being more cost-effective than Atlas. The world’s tallest wooden building is&nbsp;located in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Norway data-link=tag>Norway</a>. It&nbsp;was finished in&nbsp;March 2019. The tower is&nbsp;280 feet tall. There are 18&nbsp;floors with a&nbsp;<a href=# title=hotel data-link=tag>hotel</a>, residential apartments, offices, a&nbsp;<a href=# title=restaurant data-link=tag>restaurant</a> to&nbsp;grab a&nbsp;nice meal, and additional features such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;swimming hall.</p><p>The first ten floors are constructed of&nbsp;prefabricated wooden elements. Prefabricated means something’s built from pieces that have already been made in&nbsp;a&nbsp;factory, so&nbsp;you can put them together on&nbsp;the building site relatively quickly. Concrete makes up&nbsp;the upper floor decks. That way, the building gets more weight which is&nbsp;important for its stabilization. Prefab sections meant that the tower was finished way faster than a&nbsp;concrete building of&nbsp;the same height.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/800/aa7/1679e15385882cf163f733bc03.png><p>HoHo in&nbsp;Austria is&nbsp;the next one on&nbsp;our list, as&nbsp;the second-tallest wooden tower in&nbsp;the world. It&nbsp;has 24&nbsp;floors and is&nbsp;276 feet tall. It&nbsp;was opened to&nbsp;the public in&nbsp;2019. It’s 75&nbsp;percent wood. The rest, meaning its core, is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;concrete. Interior walls and ceilings have a&nbsp;thin layer of&nbsp;concrete that supports them. Three of&nbsp;the upper floors feature residential apartments. Check out the view, wouldn’t be&nbsp;cool to&nbsp;live here? There’s also a&nbsp;120-room hotel in&nbsp;the building, which spans nine floors. Beauty, health and wellness commercial areas, a&nbsp;restaurant, and space for business&nbsp;— this wooden tower has all you need.</p><p>Brock Commons Tall House is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;student accommodation facility. It’s located in&nbsp;Vancouver, <a href=# title=Canada data-link=tag>Canada</a>, and is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;British Columbia.&nbsp;18&nbsp;floors stretch over 174 feet in&nbsp;height. And there’s enough space to&nbsp;accommodate a&nbsp;bit more than 400&nbsp;students. Similar to&nbsp;many other wood constructions that have been rising all over the world for the past years, this building was also made of&nbsp;prefabricated parts. Because of&nbsp;that, a&nbsp;construction team was able to&nbsp;finish it&nbsp;70&nbsp;days after they got all the needed parts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/eea/50b/411b5e5a0cb236ea8b6cde7577.png><p>How would you feel spending some time in&nbsp;the biggest tree house in&nbsp;the world? Known as&nbsp;“The Minister’s Tree House”, it&nbsp;was built in&nbsp;Crossville, Tennessee. It’s gigantic, especially considering what you would expect a&nbsp;tree house to&nbsp;look like&nbsp;— it’s a&nbsp;ten-story structure with a&nbsp;“living space” of&nbsp;more than 32,290 square feet. Six oaks support&nbsp;it. Plus, over 250,000 nails have been used in&nbsp;that house since 1993. There’s a&nbsp;penthouse on&nbsp;the 10th floor. Also, there’s a&nbsp;big space in&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;the house. It’s so&nbsp;large you can literally play basketball games over there. This wasn’t an&nbsp;instant product since it&nbsp;took 14&nbsp;years to&nbsp;finish&nbsp;it. The Minister’s Tree House was completely made out of&nbsp;wood, but the costs of&nbsp;the buildings still ended up&nbsp;being about $12,000.</p><p>We’re still on&nbsp;American soil, moving to&nbsp;another large log cabin called Timber Moose Lodge. It’s in&nbsp;Heber City, Utah, and is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the biggest private log cabin in&nbsp;the United States. More than 26,000 square feet of&nbsp;living space certainly show that. It&nbsp;has 16&nbsp;bathrooms and “just” 13&nbsp;bedrooms. And a&nbsp;sauna, indoor swimming pool, outdoor decks, and balconies. And a&nbsp;magnificent view. It’s actually a&nbsp;pretty cool log cabin where you can place up&nbsp;to&nbsp;60&nbsp;people.</p><p>Going to&nbsp;Norway once again to&nbsp;see Treet, the 167-feet-tall residential block finished in&nbsp;2015, only four years after they started designing&nbsp;it. There are 64&nbsp;apartments in&nbsp;the 14-story building. People also call it ‘The Tree’ because it’s designed with wooden materials. Parts of&nbsp;the Treet’s facade are clad in&nbsp;metal and glass. This way the wood is&nbsp;safe from harsh weather conditions. The Treet’s weight is&nbsp;of&nbsp;course lighter compared to&nbsp;concrete buildings. But its structure is&nbsp;still reinforced because the construction team made a&nbsp;load-bearing framework structure from a&nbsp;glued laminate timber truss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c26/a5d/0f3f4759bfb53bed90256855b0.png><p>Log cabins were common in&nbsp;North America in&nbsp;the past. But many of&nbsp;them have been burnt down or&nbsp;destroyed in&nbsp;some other way. Of&nbsp;the last big surviving log cabins is&nbsp;Granot Loma. You can find it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the shores of&nbsp;Lake Superior in&nbsp;Michigan. More than 400 Scandinavian craftsmen got together and built Granot Loma between 1919 and 1923. One rich man simply wanted a&nbsp;nice summer home which ended up&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;large, fancy cabin log with a&nbsp;private beach and many other features for relaxation and fun. Wooden buildings are the future because it’s all about working with renewable construction materials we&nbsp;can find in&nbsp;nature. And such buildings need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;safe to&nbsp;avoid the destiny of&nbsp;the Forestry Building from the beginning. That means they need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;as&nbsp;fire-proof as&nbsp;possible.</p><p>A&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;months ago, there was the biggest mass timber fire test ever made in&nbsp;the world. Over 150 experts from across Canada, including engineers, fire officials, architects, and many others, had a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;watch a&nbsp;full-scale fire test at&nbsp;the Canadian Explosives Research Lab in&nbsp;Ottawa. They needed to&nbsp;see what would happen to&nbsp;a&nbsp;large timber construction when it’s exposed to&nbsp;fire. Hey, any guesses? Well, about 40&nbsp;minutes after the fire reached its peak, the fire self-extinguished. That means the mass timber can take fire as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;non-combustible construction. Mass timber structures can take fire even in&nbsp;the scenario where the sprinkler system won’t work, and the fire department can’t respond at&nbsp;the moment. Well, that’s encouraging!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYylpqysXay8s7jDrGSboZecsrTAjKWmoGWTlq%2Bquoywn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkeqrAjHFobnFiZXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-lost-worlds-biggest-log-cabin-what-happened-to-it-815920.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-lost-worlds-biggest-log-cabin-what-happened-to-it-815920.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-lost-worlds-biggest-log-cabin-what-happened-to-it-815920.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-lost-worlds-biggest-log-cabin-what-happened-to-it-815920.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-lost-worlds-biggest-log-cabin-what-happened-to-it-815920.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-lost-worlds-biggest-log-cabin-what-happened-to-it-815920.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-real-reason-tyra-banks-isnt-returning-to-dancing-with-the-stars.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-real-reason-tyra-banks-isnt-returning-to-dancing-with-the-stars.html>The Real Reason Tyra Banks Isn't Returning to 'Dancing With the Stars'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./test-use-your-eagle-eye-to-find-the-3d-images-hiding-in-plain-sight-798525.html>Test: Use Your Eagle Eye to Find the 3D Images Hiding in Plain Sight</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./test-use-your-eagle-eye-to-find-the-3d-images-hiding-in-plain-sight-798525.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
