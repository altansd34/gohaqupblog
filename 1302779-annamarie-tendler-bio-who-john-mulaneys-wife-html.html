And happy 8 year and 5 month anniversary to when you predicted it. Every time I see you it feels like when Leo saw Claire Danes through the aquarium."</i><h3>The engagement</h3><p class=align-left>The couple dated for a while before John proposed to the love of his life. He did so on the 9th of May 2013 and posted a cute picture on the same day.</p><p class=align-left>Later, he explained that his proposal did not go as planned. In his original plan, he would take her to a beach in Malibu and ask the big question.
