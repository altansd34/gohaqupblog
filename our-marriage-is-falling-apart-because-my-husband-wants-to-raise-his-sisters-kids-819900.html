<time>12 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Raising kids is&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge responsibility and should be&nbsp;a&nbsp;well-thought-out decision. However, life doesn’t always go&nbsp;as&nbsp;planned, which is&nbsp;what happened to&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman on<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;Reddit</a>. She <a href=# title=divorced data-link=tag>divorced</a> her husband after unexpected kids came into their lives and changed everything.</p><p><h2>The woman shared what happened.</h2></p><p>From a young age, I was sure that having or raising <a href=#>kids</a> wasn't for me. When I met my husband in college, we bonded over the fact that <strong>we both wanted a child-free life</strong>. We married a couple of years ago and are fully aligned on this.</p><p>But life had other plans. My husband's younger sister has three kids—a 5-year-old and 2-year-old twins—with different absent fathers. Two months ago, <strong>she left them with us</strong>, saying she'd run a quick errand, but she never came back. She vanished. We filed a report, and the last we heard, <strong>she was safe but had no plans to return</strong>. Now, we're stuck with the responsibility she left behind.</p><p>My husband's mom is barely getting by on minimum wage, and after raising her own kids alone, she's not in a position to take on the responsibility of raising her grandkids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66b/5b4/3ae07558568d44019704c08dfa.jpg><p>On the other hand, I’m not interested in raising them. Don’t get me wrong—I do feel sorry for these kids, but taking on the responsibility of raising children is a <strong>massive commitment</strong>, and it’s just not something I’m prepared to handle.</p><p>Since they’ve been with us for the last two months, our expenses have gone up. We’ve had to buy them <a href=#>clothes</a> and essentials, and they’re sleeping in our living room on air mattresses because we only have one bedroom. I’ve been working from<a href=#> home</a> while looking after them since <strong>daycare for three kids is extremely expensive</strong>. It’s been incredibly stressful and overwhelming.</p><p>CPS stepped in and asked us if we wanted to take on raising the kids. My answer was no. I thought my husband would agree, but to my surprise, <strong>he wanted to keep the kids</strong>. CPS has pushed us to decide quickly and said that we needed to make necessary changes, like getting a bigger <a href=# title=house data-link=tag>house</a>, to accommodate them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fb3/ee2/8af089510587a21a99612e38c5.jpg><p>My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I have been <strong>arguing nonstop</strong> about this situation. I’ve made it&nbsp;clear that&nbsp;I just can’t see myself living the next 16&nbsp;years like this. Raising kids is&nbsp;no&nbsp;joke—it’s challenging and expensive. But my&nbsp;husband is&nbsp;determined to&nbsp;step up&nbsp;for his<a href=#> family</a>, which&nbsp;I can understand.</p><p>Yesterday, <strong>I&nbsp;told him&nbsp;I wanted a&nbsp;</strong><a href=#><strong>divorce</strong></a>. I&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;quickly before he&nbsp;made any commitments that would drag me&nbsp;along with him. He&nbsp;got offended that&nbsp;I divorced him over the kids and abandoned him when he&nbsp;needed&nbsp;me.</p><p>But I&nbsp;reminded him that <strong>he&nbsp;knew my&nbsp;boundaries from the start</strong>. This kind of&nbsp;commitment is&nbsp;not something he&nbsp;can just decide on&nbsp;his own without considering what we&nbsp;both agreed to&nbsp;from the beginning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1e6/bf6/281ce5513cb8ddf7d8c9a3ec84.jpg><p>It’s clear both are struggling with this situation. The husband never expected his sister to disappear, leaving him to care for her kids. He feels obligated to step up for his nephews and niece, while his wife, who never wanted kids, has to raise them as well.</p><p><h2>People online had different points of view about the situation.</h2></p><ul><li><strong>“Forcing someone into parenthood is&nbsp;also </strong><i><strong>bad for those children</strong></i>. If&nbsp;you are ill-equipped or&nbsp;unwilling, those children will be&nbsp;the ones who suffer from&nbsp;it. They deserve parents who want them wholeheartedly, and nothing less.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cypresscoydog&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Like, what’s her husband supposed to&nbsp;do? He&nbsp;could very well still not want kids, but of&nbsp;course, he’s not going to&nbsp;abandon those poor kids in&nbsp;foster care. He’s stuck with this situation and could feel as&nbsp;upset about it&nbsp;as&nbsp;the woman. And now he&nbsp;has to&nbsp;deal with it&nbsp;all alone.<br>Like, I&nbsp;get&nbsp;it. She shouldn’t be&nbsp;there if&nbsp;she’s going to&nbsp;resent them, but&nbsp;I don’t know. <strong>I&nbsp;feel for her husband in&nbsp;this situation</strong>.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>starryeyedq&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>"Imagine as a child that your dad leaves, then your mom leaves you, your grandma can't take you in, and then your uncle and auntie give you up. The woman got dealt an awful hand, but <strong>the kids got dealt an even worse one</strong>. Terrible situation all around, but you can't fault an uncle for not giving up on his nieces and nephews just like that." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>throwAwayfor****sand / Reddit</a></li><li>"It's not surprising that your husband wouldn't want to put his nephew and nieces in foster care after a situation that there was no way to predict. There are horror stories all over the Internet and news about the broken foster system.<br>That said, you vehemently don't want kids, and if this is something you're unwilling to take on (which is your right), then <strong>it would be better to end it before the resentment of the situation</strong> takes over your life." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Hawkfan4_life / Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/421/2b8/32019b5beb8ecb9b905b4a1f1d.jpg><p>Which side are you on?
