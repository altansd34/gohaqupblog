<time>20 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>One thing most <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>narcissists</a> have in&nbsp;common is&nbsp;believing that they are better than everyone else. That’s why their 2&nbsp;strategies that often merge are constantly boosting themselves or&nbsp;putting everyone else down. They will often appear super charming in&nbsp;an&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;be&nbsp;likable to&nbsp;others, but they are this close to&nbsp;start talking bad to&nbsp;them or&nbsp;about them. And when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;breakups, they can be&nbsp;truly unpleasant and malicious.</p><p>A&nbsp;breakup is&nbsp;never a&nbsp;pleasant thing and <strong>Bright Side </strong>would like you to&nbsp;be&nbsp;prepared in&nbsp;case you’re breaking up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;narcissist.</p><p><h2>1. They will try to&nbsp;make you stay by&nbsp;making you feel guilty.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a3a/6ab/91de4c52c19e50e8d39e0a82ad.jpg><p>After all the blaming has begun, a&nbsp;narcissist’s effort is&nbsp;to&nbsp;simply make you feel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>guilty</a> for your decision to&nbsp;break up&nbsp;with them. They will tell you that you inflicted so&nbsp;much pain on&nbsp;them and were inconsiderate of&nbsp;their feelings and all the nice things they’ve done for you. <strong>There is&nbsp;so&nbsp;much name-calling</strong> that you start to&nbsp;feel like the scum of&nbsp;the earth. According to&nbsp;them, you’ve been very wrong about them, and you should reconsider your stance.</p><p>And on&nbsp;many occasions, <strong>people decide to&nbsp;give their relationship another&nbsp;go</strong>. It’s not always because they still love their partner, but because they want to&nbsp;prove to&nbsp;them that they are not that awful. But they might continue this narrative even in&nbsp;the relationship and keep you <a href=# title=engaged data-link=tag>engaged</a> by&nbsp;guilt until they get tired and end&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>2. They will try to&nbsp;throw the blame on&nbsp;you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/93a/9d1/cba9f55ff892babe802dfe726d.jpg><p>When 2&nbsp;people break up&nbsp;it’s usually because both of&nbsp;them took wrong turns along the way. However, a&nbsp;narcissist <strong>will never accept any blame</strong> and will toss all of&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;their partner who chose to&nbsp;break up&nbsp;with them. They might tell you that you didn’t appreciate all the wonderful things they did for you. You will suddenly become an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>enemy</a> for them that they will not even speak&nbsp;to.</p><p>They won’t hesitate to&nbsp;insult you in&nbsp;the most disgusting of&nbsp;ways in&nbsp;an&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;hurt you as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;you hurt them. Even if&nbsp;you try to&nbsp;apologize and help them get over&nbsp;it, they will refuse to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;you. They <strong>might even convince you that it&nbsp;was all your fault</strong> and that you should give the relationship a&nbsp;second chance. But this effort will probably be&nbsp;short-lived, since all the negative aspects of&nbsp;it&nbsp;will start resurfacing.</p><p><h2>3. They will make a&nbsp;promise that they will change.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/867/c57/85ec205921a47756706b67e744.jpg><p>When their <a href=# title=manipulating data-link=tag>manipulating</a> methods fail to&nbsp;get you back, a&nbsp;narcissist will appear as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they’ve understood their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mistakes</a>. <strong>They will look like a&nbsp;changed person</strong> in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;you and promise that they will change their ways. They say that they will get the help they need and do&nbsp;what you say in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;make you happy. And sometimes the other person will believe them and decide to&nbsp;accept them back.</p><p>However, it&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;long until the narcissist goes back to&nbsp;the way they were acting before. Once they feel comfortable that you trust them once again, <strong>they will try to&nbsp;control you</strong> and be&nbsp;insensitive. Now that they know their plan worked the first time, they will repeat it&nbsp;next time you want to&nbsp;break up&nbsp;with them again.</p><p><h2>4. They will demand your attention in&nbsp;any way they can.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e1a/561/a0a6785eb1916438871a38db54.jpg><p>They still want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;at&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;your <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attention</a> so&nbsp;bad that they will accidentally bump into you. They might also <strong>happen to&nbsp;pass by&nbsp;your house</strong> or&nbsp;the bar that you often go&nbsp;with your friends after work. They might even pretend that they are sick or&nbsp;that something terrible happened to&nbsp;them just to&nbsp;get you on&nbsp;your toes.</p><p>Other worrisome <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>behaviors</a> are drunk calls in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the night or&nbsp;even <strong>breaking into your home</strong> in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;get their stuff. Their ego is&nbsp;so&nbsp;massive that they need to&nbsp;feel seen, heard, and acknowledged by&nbsp;their ex-partner.</p><p><h2>5. They will shame you in&nbsp;public and create malicious gossip.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e34/c22/4e1fda500484797fae731f39f5.jpg><p>Once again, their ego is&nbsp;speaking volumes, and they won’t stop until they ridicule you in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;your loved ones and complete strangers. They might start <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shaming</a> you in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend or&nbsp;family gathering in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;break you emotionally. To&nbsp;their friends, <strong>they present a&nbsp;completely different story than what happened</strong>, where they are victims and you are the perpetrator.</p><p>They don’t care at&nbsp;all about how much they are hurting you as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;they see you suffering. Not only that, but they might create fake stories and narratives in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;present you as&nbsp;the big villain. <strong><a href=# title="Social media" data-link=tag>Social media</a> could be&nbsp;their vehicle</strong>, since they can post any harmful thing they want in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;damage your reputation.</p><p><h2>6. They can be&nbsp;extremely brutal and unsympathetic.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fd0/71b/31af9b56b088eb1c4129a487f5.jpg><p>When they are the ones that initiate the breakup, it&nbsp;might come as&nbsp;completely <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>unexpected</a> to&nbsp;you because they were extremely loving until just yesterday and <strong>pretended to&nbsp;have feelings that they didn’t have</strong>. They lack the basic emotion of&nbsp;empathy and don’t care the least bit about how hurt you are. They will not hesitate to&nbsp;say even more hurtful things to&nbsp;you if&nbsp;they can get you off their back that way.</p><p>In&nbsp;this case, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;remember that this breakup is&nbsp;not your fault. They were playing with you and your feelings for so&nbsp;long until they felt that it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;conquer someone else’s love. And <strong>if&nbsp;they ever decide to&nbsp;come back</strong>, it’s not because they truly love you, but because they want something more from you.</p><p><h2>7. They will resort to&nbsp;emotional breakdowns.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/10d/a86/738ceb5366a346969a1deca4e1.jpg><p>In&nbsp;most relationships, there are certain hardships that people go&nbsp;through, and their partner supports them as&nbsp;they go&nbsp;through them. <strong>Be&nbsp;prepared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;reminded</strong> of&nbsp;how much they supported you during that time. And now you are hurting them so&nbsp;much by&nbsp;being so&nbsp;inconsiderate of&nbsp;their feelings. They will probably start crying and get <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hysterical</a>.</p><p>In&nbsp;combination with their need for attention, they might ask to&nbsp;come by&nbsp;and get their things and instead break down in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;you. That’s why it’s better to&nbsp;<strong>arrange for someone else to&nbsp;hand them their belongings</strong>. You don’t have to&nbsp;meet with them if&nbsp;you feel like they might become abusive or&nbsp;manipulative.</p><p><h2>8. They will focus on&nbsp;your drawbacks.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/442/391/5e14995265affda37892b07fff.jpg><p>That one time you called them for help will probably be&nbsp;brought up&nbsp;after you tell a&nbsp;narcissist that you want to&nbsp;break&nbsp;up. Their plan is&nbsp;to&nbsp;prove to&nbsp;you how much you <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>need them</a> and how much more difficult your life will be&nbsp;without them. <strong>They will dig up&nbsp;instances</strong> of&nbsp;when you asked for their help as&nbsp;proof that you need them in&nbsp;your life in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;function properly.</p><p>If&nbsp;your confidence isn’t at&nbsp;its highest, this plan can be&nbsp;very successful. Remember that narcissists can often <strong>see through people’s weaknesses</strong> and use them to&nbsp;their benefit. Things that you never realized were bothering them will be&nbsp;mentioned now that you don’t want them next to&nbsp;you anymore.</p><p>Have you ever been together with a&nbsp;narcissist?
