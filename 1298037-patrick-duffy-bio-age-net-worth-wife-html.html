He is 70 years old. Born in a city called Townsend in the State of Montana, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the star grew up</a> with a passion for acting. In high school, the star was an active member of the drama club.</p><p class=align-left>He later attended the University of Washington where he studied drama and successfully graduated.

Like many other people, he spent several years trying to make this dream come true. Finally, he got his big break by landing a role in <i>Man From Atlantis</i>.</p><p class=align-left>Soon after, Patrick landed the role of Bobby Ewing on<i> Dallas</i>. To date, this remains his most popular role. The soap opera <a href=# title="Patrick Duffy movies and tv shows" rel="nofollow noopener">was a massive hit</a>. One particular episode of the show attracted 360 million viewers.</p><p class=align-left>After the seventh season, the actor chose to leave the show. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to him</a>, he didn’t want to be typecast as the token good boy. He wanted to be known for more than being a Dallas actor. Since his career was at its peak at the time, he thought that it would be easy for him to venture out and do something new. Considering Patrick Duffy age at the time, he stood a chance of reinventing himself.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4880a3778b657987.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The fascinating story of John Krasinski: what is "The Office" star up to?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Patrick’s expectations turned out to be far from reality.
