His father was an athlete who later turned into an international entrepreneur. However, he hardly shares much about his personal life on social media. For this reason, it is almost impossible to establish the names of his parents and all his siblings.</p><p class=align-left>He has one brother whose name is Wesley Andersen. The two brothers are the brains behind the establishment of Walter Sky.</p><p class=align-left>He had a fun childhood experience. Growing up, he spent most of his time climbing, collecting, and roaming. With time, the activities became his favourites, all through the support of his family.</p><h3>Educational background</h3><p class=align-left>Nathan <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">studied film</a> at Utah Valley University (Utah Valley University), which is based in Salt Lake City. Interestingly, he was in the same learning institution with AJ Cook.</p><h3>How old is Nathan Andersen?</h3><p class=align-left>Nathan Andersen age is 42 as of 2020.

He is a businessperson, fashion designer, and adventure traveller. His passion significantly inspired his choice of profession. However, it has not been a smooth journey, as some may perceive.</p><p class=align-left>After graduating from Utah Valley University (UVU), Nathan ventured into the showbiz scene – Hollywood entertainment. Unfortunately, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">left the industry</a> because he realized his passion was elsewhere.</p><p class=align-left>Nathan realized he was more of a businessperson than an entertainer. Therefore, he joined a friend who was establishing a startup business. He went ahead to invest his resources and time in the business for a decade.</p><p class=align-left>The business flourished, but again being an adventurous individual, he came up with another idea. Inspired by his passion for travelling, he resolved to establish <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Walter Sky</a> alongside Wesley Andersen.
