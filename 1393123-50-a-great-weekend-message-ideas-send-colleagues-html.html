Furthermore, it is well deserved to be joyous and excited about the two-day vacation, considering the long wait all week long.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/295da56b25f34888.jpg><p class=align-left>Funny weekend quotes will most definitely make you forget the existing gloomy nature and boredom in your life. Your colleagues will always appreciate a funny message that adds a little flavor to their two-day vacation.</p><ul><li>I told you better days would come. They are called Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Enjoy!</li><li>You better enjoy yourself. You know someone is about to push the fast forward button. One minute it would be Saturday and then boom, it will be Monday morning real fast.</li><li>I want you to have a wonderful time remembering one thing; paychecks and weekends have a lot in common; they are short and do not last long enough.</li><li>Just wanted to remind you one thing; a weekend wasted is not a wasted end of the week.</li><li>Do you know what they say? Weekends are like rainbows. They look great from a distance, but once you get up close to them, they start to disappear.</li><li>Make sure you go wild. The responsible adult button has been switched off. Start multi-slacking instead of multi-tasking.</li><li>If anyone tells you that you drink too much on the weekends, stop talking to them. You do not need that kind of negativity in your life.</li><li>Today is Sunday. Share this, and within seven days you will get another Sunday. It works. My friend ignored this message, and he got a Monday within 24 hours.</li><li>The end of the week workout routine is simple and straightforward. You dance and drink. It is called Barcardio.</li><li>Always makes sure to give 100% at work: 12% on Monday, 23% on Tuesday, 40% on Wednesday, 20% on Thursday, and 5% on Friday. Welcome back to the end of the week.</li><li>Happiness has a simple definition; not having to set the alarm for the next day. Have a nice weekend.</li><li>Beware, boys! It is Friday night. Either keep your wallet stuffed, or you will have to say to your girlfriends that you lost it.</li><li>Whomsoever said there are no happy endings had not tasted the end of the week.</li><li>I have concluded that the end of the week is a man. After you meet up, you do not hear from it for a week.</li><li>I have been messing up the entire Saturday and Sunday, and my wrist is killing me.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a23bd26434c9eb38.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ deep resilience quotes to help you overcome any difficulties</span></p></a><h2>Motivational messages for a happy weekend</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e416e8c971e4f437.jpg><p class=align-left>We all know how exhausting Mondays can be sometimes. It is always interesting how it seems like the end of the week flies by so fast, but Mondays seem to last forever. Motivational messages will help remind your co-workers that they are exceptional and doing a great job.</p><ul><li>Do not stress yourself that there is no chance for you to relax. The perfect time is here. Relax and have a good time with your friends and family. Share the love and laughter. Have a nice one.</li><li>Happiness comes with a price tag. If someone is smiling, they have already paid for it in the past. Have a good weekend.</li><li>The only limits you have in your life are the ones you set for yourself. Break all your boundaries and have a blast.</li><li>Happiness does not come with Saturday and Sunday. It depends on what you think and how you take things.</li><li>One thing you will never get back is your wasted time. Never be too lazy to enjoy yourself. Celebrate and make lots of memories. Celebrate your Saturdays and Sundays with every second you got.</li><li>Do not let the weekend become your weak end.</li><li>Be the person who will tell people how much you worked hard on Saturday and Sunday while everybody else was out wasting their precious time.</li><li>Wherever you go on this beautiful Saturday, make sure you always remember to bring that same energy and happiness with you on Monday.</li><li>Do not erase all your hard work because it is the end of the week.</li><li>Cheers to you! Keep working for your dreams, not for the end of the week.</li><li>Weekends are fun, not because you do not get to work, but because you get to sit down, relax, and enjoy the fruits of your labor. It is great because it tells you one thing – ‘You earned this.’</li><li>Be in the habit of getting up bright and early on Saturday and Sunday. Why waste such precious time in bed?</li><li>It is okay if your Saturdays and Sundays do not lead to big moments, or campfires, or laughter that carries on for hours and hours. Some weekends might be quiet, still, and with plenty of room to contemplate. And in those moments of contemplation, there is room to grow.</li><li>I hope you will not let a break ruin your progress. Waking up early in the morning gives us more time to do things we love. Maintain the same schedule as it makes it easier to wake up.</li><li>I have an idea for the best Saturday and Sunday you could ever have. Spend it on simple pleasures that give your body and mind the chance to rest and relax.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1f25ab09393fcd0c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30+ relatable tired meme ideas to exchange with your coworkers</span></p></a><h2>Enjoy your weekend sweet messages</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a23bd26434c9eb38.jpg><p class=align-left>Kind words are a great way to express your feelings to other people.
