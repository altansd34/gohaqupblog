Here is what you should know about rocks, including rock cycle facts.</p><ul><li>The major construction material of the Pyramid of Giza in Egypt is limestone, a sedimentary rock.</li><li>Electronics such as radios and watches are made using Quartz. Quartz maintains an accurate frequency standard, making it desirable for use in electronics.</li><li>Sand is one of the raw materials used in making glass. It is combined with other materials, heated at high temperatures, and forms glass when it cools.</li><li>Gold, one of the most precious metals in the world, is underexploited. It is estimated that 80% of gold has not been discovered.</li><li>Minerals are pure inorganic substances, and that makes pure metals to be minerals.</li><li>The <a href=#>most expensive</a> mineral is Jadeite. One carat of the mineral can fetch up to $3 million.</li><li>The Sandstone in the Sothern Alps of New Zealand is the fastest eroding rock.

Scientists have estimated that the earth could be 4.54 billion years old.</li><li>Pumice is the lightest rock on earth. Due to the rock’s porous structure, it floats on water.</li><li>Shale is the most abundant sedimentary rock. It is about 70% of sedimentary rocks on earth.</li><li>Rocks form some breathtaking landmarks on earth. Some of the notable ones include Balancing rock (Canada), Old Harry rocks (Cyprus), Aphrodite’s rocks (England), Uluru aka Ayers Rock (Australia), and Horseshoe Bend (Arizona, USA).</li><li>The hardness of a mineral is measured using the Mohs mineral hardness scale. The device was invented by German mineralogist freidrich Mohs.</li><li>Humans consider gemstones highly valuable due to their scarcity, beauty, and durability.

It becomes lava when it comes to the earth's surface and when it cools, it forms rocks.</li><li>Rocks are formed from volcanic activities, deposition of sediments, and subjection to mechanical force or heating.</li><li>The most common rock on earth is sedimentary rock. It forms about 66% of the earth’s surface.</li><li>Meteorites are space rocks that fall on the earth. In most cases, they fall into the ocean.</li><li>Rocks were the first tools used by humans, and today, they are an <a href=#>important material</a> in building construction.</li><li>Rocks continuously transform, changing from one type to another. The changes occur naturally in the presence of heat and pressure.</li><li>Some rocks have weird shapes m, resulting in myths about them.

The original forms of the rock are subjected to high heat or pressure. Below are facts you ought to know about the rocks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9be69506006e2b4e.jpg><ul><li>An original that has not been metamorphosed is called a protolith. It can be a sedimentary, igneous, or existing metamorphic rock.</li><li>Metamorphic rocks are classified into two groups, foliated and non-foliated rocks.</li><li>Foliated metamorphic rocks are formed when a rock with elongated mineral deposits is under high pressure, making the minerals align to the direction of the pressure.</li><li>Igneous rock such as granite can undergo the process, forming igneous gneiss.</li><li>Non-foliated metamorphic also form under high-pressure exertion, but the rocks do not have mineral deposits hence mineral alignment or layering.</li><li>Heat and pressure can also transform sedimentary rocks such as bituminous coal, sandstone, and limestone to non-foliated metamorphic rocks like marble, quartzite, and anthracite coal.</li><li>To form metamorphic rock, a rock should be subjected to a temperature of at least 200 degrees Celsius and pressure of not less than 100 megapascals.</li><li>Examples of metamorphic rocks are Gneiss, Slate, Schist, Marble, and Quartzite. Some rocks, such as Slate and Quartzite, are used for construction.</li><li>Some minerals in metamorphic rocks include Micas, Kyanite, Pyroxenes, Sillimanite, Olivines, and Garnet.</li><li>They form 12% of the earth’s surface.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6e0e91f466a0a734.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most expensive cheese 2019 and its price will wow you</span></p></a><h2>Facts about igneous rocks</h2><p class=align-left>The word igneous comes from the Latin phrase "formed from fire". Therefore, igneous rocks are made from solidified magma and lava from the earth’s volcanic activities. Here are fascinating facts about these types of rocks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/33d6276d91ed53b0.jpg><ul><li>The rocks may also be referred to as magmatic rocks.</li><li>The rocks form approximately 15% of the earth’s land surface and a significant proportion of the earth’s oceanic crust.</li><li>These rocks are formed from volcanic activities involving magma emission from the earth’s crust.</li><li>The mineral composition of igneous rocks can provide information about the minerals in the lower crust.</li><li>The rocks can be intrusive or extrusive depending on whether the molten material is below or above the<a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/guides/1157833-5-types-land-tenure-system-nigeria/ href=#> earth's surface</a>.</li><li>Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools in the earth’s crust. The slow cooling process makes them have large crystals.</li><li>Intrusive igneous rocks are also plutonic rocks, and their rough surface texture is called phaneritic texture.</li><li>The most common intrusive igneous rocks are Granite and Diorite.</li><li>Extrusive rocks form when magma erupts into lava on the surface and cools to form the rocks on the earth's surface.</li><li>The cooling process of lava on the earth's surface is fast and does not allow the formation of crystals. Therefore, the rocks have small grains and fine textures.</li><li>The most known types of extrusive igneous rocks are basalt and obsidian rocks.</li><li>The formation of the obsidian rock is so fast that it is impossible to see the grains with bare eyes unless with the help of a microscope. The rock almost appears as glass.</li><li>Pumice is an extrusive igneous rock formed when gas is trapped in the cooling lava forming a vesicular texture.</li><li>The rocks may have deposits of important minerals such as tungsten, tin, chromium, platinum, and uranium.</li><li>Igneous rocks are predominately on the moon’s surface.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b1fe07dbff70eeec.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>States where limestone is found in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>With the above facts about rocks, now you know that they are not the usual stones you see around you.
