<time>19 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>A&nbsp;woman, 28, has turned to&nbsp;Reddit to&nbsp;seek advice regarding her absolutely crazy family situation. She’s a&nbsp;mom to&nbsp;an&nbsp;11-months-old <a href=# title=baby data-link=tag>baby</a>, and one day, together with her husband, they invited a&nbsp;nanny to&nbsp;look after their little baby. It&nbsp;turned out that the nanny was looking not only after their daughter, but after the woman’s husband, too. At&nbsp;least this is&nbsp;what the new mom thought after finding some really suggestive photos of&nbsp;the nanny in&nbsp;her husband’s belongings.</p><p><h2>The happy family just wanted to&nbsp;hire a&nbsp;good nanny for their small daughter.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/11a/c49/f07bed5322a053394aac51b0d4.jpg><p>The woman opened her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a> saying that she was new to&nbsp;Reddit, but her little sister suggested she wrote to&nbsp;this platform. She’s 28, her daughter’s name is&nbsp;Cassie, and she is&nbsp;11&nbsp;months old and her husband, Alex, is&nbsp;35. The woman had her daughter and then returned to&nbsp;work (psychologist) as&nbsp;she could never be&nbsp;a&nbsp;SAHM.</p><p>She’s actually French but lives in&nbsp;the US. So&nbsp;when she returned at&nbsp;the 4-month mark, as&nbsp;she had a&nbsp;difficult birth, the family started looking for a&nbsp;nanny to&nbsp;look after Cassie whilst the woman and her husband Alex were at&nbsp;work.</p><p>They saw a&nbsp;few girls, but then one of&nbsp;Alex’s colleagues suggested his daughter, who had dropped out of&nbsp;college. The woman called her Liv, she was 20&nbsp;years old.</p><p><h2>The nanny’s behavior soon became a&nbsp;problem for the family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cee/77c/cee1845cfcb3f2bccc11dc1180.jpg><p>The woman goes on&nbsp;with her story, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a> that everything went well, except for one thing. The woman says she did notice Liv being quite attached to&nbsp;Cassie, but she brushed it&nbsp;off as&nbsp;a&nbsp;good friendship between the two. The nanny also liked Alex, it&nbsp;was obvious she had a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;him, always batting her lashes and giggling. The author of&nbsp;the post says she actually found it&nbsp;amusing, as&nbsp;she’s confident in&nbsp;herself. Alex always laughed it&nbsp;off with her, too.</p><p>But then on&nbsp;Thursday night, he&nbsp;asked his wife to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something on&nbsp;his phone whilst he&nbsp;bathed Cassie, and she saw some pictures flash up&nbsp;from Liv. When the woman looked at&nbsp;them, they were obviously very suggestive, she was wearing lingerie and was shown in&nbsp;provocative poses. The woman looked back at&nbsp;the history, and she had been sending these for a&nbsp;while.</p><p><h2>The woman went totally mad at&nbsp;Liv’s provocative deeds.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a33/cb3/f9b1635f2e8c3c98a47a3d402d.jpg><p>The woman revealed that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Alex</a> has never responded, but obviously texts could have been deleted. When she asked him, he&nbsp;got defensive and told her to&nbsp;stop using her psychiatrist tricks on&nbsp;him.</p><p>She was not happy with his non answers, and it&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;shouting match, waking Cassie. So&nbsp;the woman got him a&nbsp;bag and threw him out. She wrote, “I&nbsp;told him he’s not welcome back until&nbsp;I have answers. I’m considering taking Cassie back home to&nbsp;see my&nbsp;family in&nbsp;<a href=# title=France data-link=tag>France</a> for a&nbsp;little bit. His mother and friends have been blowing up&nbsp;my&nbsp;phone saying I’m being too harsh, and they were harmless texts. Nevertheless, I&nbsp;feel disrespected, and that doesn’t fly with&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>The whole story took a&nbsp;serious turn.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e7e/9b3/62847d5afdb81e5a0753df26c2.jpg><p>So, after going to&nbsp;France to&nbsp;visit her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>parents</a> immediately after what happened, the woman agreed with her family that she needed to&nbsp;come home to&nbsp;France with her daughter. Her family said they would provide any help she needed with moving and lawyers.</p><p>When she returned to&nbsp;the&nbsp;US, she informed her ex&nbsp;fiancé (whom she initially called a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>husband</a>) that there would be&nbsp;no&nbsp;compromise or&nbsp;discussion on&nbsp;her next steps. They managed to&nbsp;sort the move out in&nbsp;the next 2&nbsp;months and signed an&nbsp;agreement which stated she was the primary custodian of&nbsp;their daughter, and she made most decisions regarding her. Alex thought his partner would become more sympathetic and let him back in&nbsp;once they were in&nbsp;France. But the woman decided on&nbsp;everything and had just let him&nbsp;go.</p><p>And here’s yet another life dilemma from a&nbsp;woman who had to&nbsp;kick out her own <a href=#>pregnant daughter</a> with her 6&nbsp;kids, and the reason for this was just mind-blowing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZut8icop6cXaLGbrTUrJmappRivLbAjKidZqyYmnqpu9SsnGaZlqmys3nFoqWdoZ6cerG%2Bzq%2BmnJmknsOmec%2Bhpq2no2Kzs7vMZquhnV2jrq%2B62GZvam9kZ4Fw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-kicked-my-husband-out-of-the-house-after-finding-provocative-photos-from-the-nanny-817424.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fi-kicked-my-husband-out-of-the-house-after-finding-provocative-photos-from-the-nanny-817424.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fi-kicked-my-husband-out-of-the-house-after-finding-provocative-photos-from-the-nanny-817424.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fi-kicked-my-husband-out-of-the-house-after-finding-provocative-photos-from-the-nanny-817424.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-kicked-my-husband-out-of-the-house-after-finding-provocative-photos-from-the-nanny-817424.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-kicked-my-husband-out-of-the-house-after-finding-provocative-photos-from-the-nanny-817424.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-that-your-grandpa-salma-hayek-shares-a-photo-with-her-husband-and-causes-a-stir-among-fans-813499.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-that-your-grandpa-salma-hayek-shares-a-photo-with-her-husband-and-causes-a-stir-among-fans-813499.html>Is that your grandpa?: Salma Hayek Shares a Photo With Her Husband And Causes a Stir Among Fan</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./i-think-i-just-made-the-biggest-mistake-of-my-life-818551.html>I Think I Just Made the Biggest Mistake of My Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./i-think-i-just-made-the-biggest-mistake-of-my-life-818551.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
