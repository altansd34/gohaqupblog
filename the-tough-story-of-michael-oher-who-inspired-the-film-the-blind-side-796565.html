<time>06 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>When some saw such a&nbsp;large and quiet teenager, they thought that there was nothing really special about him. However, just watching him on&nbsp;the <a href=# title=football data-link=tag>football</a> field was enough to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;clear that he&nbsp;was very talented. Yet his road to&nbsp;success was not an&nbsp;easy one. Fortunately, though, fate put people in&nbsp;his path who believed in&nbsp;him and saw beyond his size or&nbsp;the color of&nbsp;his skin.</p><p>We’re talking about Michael Oher, whose <a href=#>story</a> inspired the film The Blind Side. His life had a&nbsp;difficult beginning, but it&nbsp;became a&nbsp;lesson about effort, <a href=# title=empathy data-link=tag>empathy</a>, and solidarity, and that’s why <strong>Bright Side</strong> wants to&nbsp;share more details about it&nbsp;with you.</p><p><h2 align=center>Who was this big guy?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/75d/83b/ee7ed458259c67768888875dc4.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2002, in&nbsp;Memphis, little was known about the 16-year-old <a href=#>boy</a>, who was practically homeless and slept on&nbsp;the floor of&nbsp;whoever gave him shelter for a&nbsp;few days. One of&nbsp;those kind people was Tony Henderson, known simply as&nbsp;“Big Tony,” who applied for Michael to&nbsp;be&nbsp;accepted into Briarcrest Christian School, thinking he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great addition to&nbsp;their basketball team.</p><p>However, the academic record of&nbsp;“Big Mike” (as&nbsp;Michael was nicknamed) could not be&nbsp;more discouraging: he&nbsp;had an&nbsp;IQ of&nbsp;80, and he&nbsp;had already been to&nbsp;11&nbsp;different public schools. Besides, for more than a&nbsp;year he&nbsp;had not attended any school, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;repeat 2&nbsp;grades, and had so&nbsp;many absences that the only explanation for why his teachers passed him to&nbsp;the next grade level was that <strong>they were just trying to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;him so&nbsp;that he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem for some other institution</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a6/9e2/b7840859ae9a00ceed0963ccc1.jpg><p>Eventually, the people at&nbsp;Briarcrest learned that Big Mike had 11&nbsp;other siblings, that his father had been killed, and that his mother was suffering from addiction, which is&nbsp;why Michael had spent time in&nbsp;foster care. At&nbsp;first, the director denied him admission to&nbsp;the institution, but thanks to&nbsp;pressure from the football coach, and after realizing that <strong>it&nbsp;was Michael’s only chance to&nbsp;continue studying</strong>, he&nbsp;accepted it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the condition that he&nbsp;would not participate in&nbsp;any extracurricular activities, not even in&nbsp;the chorus, until he&nbsp;demonstrated that he&nbsp;was capable of&nbsp;improving academically.</p><p>The problem was that Michael had had such a&nbsp;<a href=# title=poor data-link=tag>poor</a> academic and life experience that it&nbsp;almost seemed as&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;had simply materialized out of&nbsp;the blue into a&nbsp;16-year-old guy. He&nbsp;had never heard of&nbsp;what a&nbsp;verb or&nbsp;a&nbsp;noun was, he&nbsp;didn’t talk much, and he&nbsp;barely shook hands with the director. So, a&nbsp;few weeks after his admission, <strong>several teachers suggested that he&nbsp;should leave</strong>.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;helping hand</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8e8/e32/e347375043852a37ae0341f883.jpg><p>Collins Tuohy, a&nbsp;sophomore at&nbsp;Briarcrest, told her parents that she had seen <strong>a&nbsp;black boy at&nbsp;school who was remarkably large and always wore the same clothes</strong>. One day, her father, Sean, met Michael while they were both watching a&nbsp;basketball practice. After that incident he&nbsp;asked the school cafeteria for a&nbsp;permanent account to&nbsp;be&nbsp;opened for Michael, something he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;do&nbsp;for the poorest kids who went to&nbsp;school there.</p><p>Sean Tuohy was the epitome of&nbsp;American success, a&nbsp;prosperous white man who owned 60&nbsp;restaurants and his own private jet. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;hobby he&nbsp;would visit the institution and act as&nbsp;a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;consultant for the coaches of&nbsp;the sports teams. He&nbsp;even contributed money to&nbsp;the school fund to&nbsp;pay for some students’ tuition.</p><p><h2>His first steps in&nbsp;football</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/db1/6e8/693ae350a291048584e51851dd.jpg><p>At&nbsp;school, Michael was able to&nbsp;improve his grades a&nbsp;little when his teachers realized that it&nbsp;was more convenient for him to&nbsp;take the exams orally, rather than in&nbsp;writing. So, at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;his second year, he&nbsp;joined the basketball team, then the track team, and <strong>in&nbsp;his third year, he&nbsp;finally made it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the football field</strong>.</p><p>During one of&nbsp;his first practices, Michael showed that he&nbsp;was more than just a&nbsp;big guy who could intimidate the opposing team because of&nbsp;his size. To&nbsp;everyone’s surprise, Big Mike took a&nbsp;practice dummy that weighed at&nbsp;least 50&nbsp;pounds and <strong>ran with it&nbsp;at&nbsp;high speed</strong>, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;weighed nothing. The boy weighed about 344 pounds and was 6’4″, so&nbsp;the others thought that would make him slow when running, but they were wrong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a9/74b/823030529480410d58a26bf159.jpg><p>While Michael worked on&nbsp;improving his football skills, he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;spend his nights with 5&nbsp;different families, including the Tuohys. One day, after a&nbsp;training session, Leigh Ann offered to&nbsp;take him wherever he&nbsp;wanted, but after seeing the conditions he&nbsp;was living&nbsp;in, she decided to&nbsp;take him home for good. This was a&nbsp;turning point for Michael’s life, since <strong>it&nbsp;was the first time he&nbsp;would have his own bed</strong>. He&nbsp;became the third son of&nbsp;a&nbsp;rich family, and even had a&nbsp;good relationship with the Tuohy siblings.</p><p>Big Mike began playing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;defensive tackle, but his main problem on&nbsp;the field was that he&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;not understand very well what was going on&nbsp;around him. He&nbsp;was passive and had no&nbsp;intention of&nbsp;attacking anyone. However, word spread that <strong>he&nbsp;was an&nbsp;insurmountable wall</strong>, which is&nbsp;why several college football coaches wanted him on&nbsp;their teams. He&nbsp;then became a&nbsp;left tackle, one of&nbsp;the most valuable positions in&nbsp;football.</p><p><h2>Lots of&nbsp;talent, low grades</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0aa/22c/90439e5bc3afcc2b47b74d3e45.jpg><p>No&nbsp;matter how good he&nbsp;was at&nbsp;football, Michael could never play in&nbsp;the NFL if&nbsp;he&nbsp;didn’t get a&nbsp;better GPA that would get him into college. Leigh Anne decided to&nbsp;take action and talked to&nbsp;Michael’s teachers to&nbsp;ask what he&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;to&nbsp;get his grades&nbsp;up. No&nbsp;matter what it&nbsp;was, he&nbsp;would do&nbsp;it.</p><p>Supported by&nbsp;Leigh Ann and a&nbsp;tutor who taught him 5&nbsp;days a&nbsp;week, <strong>Michael went from having one of&nbsp;the lowest GPAs to&nbsp;being a&nbsp;reliable member of&nbsp;the honor roll</strong>. Despite his efforts, his grades in&nbsp;the early years were so&nbsp;low that he&nbsp;fell short when it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;the final GPA he&nbsp;needed.</p><p>So&nbsp;it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;move on&nbsp;to&nbsp;plan B.&nbsp;Sean suggested courses that were offered online by&nbsp;a&nbsp;college. They had the power to&nbsp;replace a&nbsp;full semester’s grades with a&nbsp;new evaluation that would only take a&nbsp;few weeks. So, Michael was able to&nbsp;remove the F’s from his classes and replace them with A’s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/296/291/32aabd55e894ac47f947230782.jpg><p>Michael was ready to&nbsp;graduate, only one small detail was missing: a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;him as&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby, since it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;Briarcrest tradition to&nbsp;place a&nbsp;recent photo of&nbsp;the student in&nbsp;the school yearbook along with a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;the student as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child. But <strong>Michael didn’t have any pictures of&nbsp;himself</strong>, so&nbsp;Leigh Anne visited some of&nbsp;the foster families he&nbsp;had been&nbsp;in, and she even visited his biological mother. Yet she only found one photo of&nbsp;Michael when he&nbsp;was about 10&nbsp;years old.</p><p>But Leigh Ann wouldn’t allow him to&nbsp;just have a&nbsp;blank space in&nbsp;the yearbook, so&nbsp;she turned on&nbsp;her computer, downloaded “the cutest picture of&nbsp;a&nbsp;black baby she could find,” and turned it&nbsp;into the school.</p><p><h2>The beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bright future</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ec/3b9/71a65952ddb3c549ed5200833d.jpg><p>In&nbsp;May 2005, Big Mike had an&nbsp;emotional graduation ceremony surrounded by&nbsp;the people who helped him make&nbsp;it: his new family, his tutor, his coach, the school principal, and the man who brought him to&nbsp;Briarcrest in&nbsp;the first place, Big Tony.</p><p>Despite the fact that Michael still had some difficulty getting into college, he&nbsp;was eventually accepted to&nbsp;The University of&nbsp;Mississippi, where his&nbsp;IQ was re-evaluated and was found to&nbsp;have risen between 20&nbsp;to&nbsp;30&nbsp;points. He&nbsp;was also on&nbsp;the honor roll several times, and in&nbsp;2009&nbsp;he <a href=#>graduated</a> with a&nbsp;degree in&nbsp;Criminal Justice.</p><p>After his time in&nbsp;college football, he&nbsp;signed a&nbsp;5-year, $13.8 million contract with the Baltimore Ravens, with whom he&nbsp;was crowned <strong>champion in&nbsp;2013, by&nbsp;winning Super Bowl XLVII</strong>. He&nbsp;later joined the Tennessee Titans and the Carolina Panthers. Although he&nbsp;is&nbsp;not officially retired, he&nbsp;has not played in&nbsp;the NFL since <a href=#>2017</a>. He&nbsp;now lives quietly in&nbsp;Tennessee and continues to&nbsp;live with the Tuohys.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3f0/cd8/e995ee5207a85b0d37a4cfb3d8.jpg><p>Michael Oher’s story is&nbsp;an&nbsp;example of&nbsp;how, with perseverance and support, dreams that seemed impossible can come true.</p><p>What did you like the most about this story?
