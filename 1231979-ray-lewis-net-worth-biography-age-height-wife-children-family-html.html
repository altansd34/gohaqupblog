It is estimated at stunning <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$45 million</a>, and moreover, his annual salary is believed to be $7 million! He spent the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">entire seventeen-year career</a> only with his team – the Baltimore Ravens.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/927bdcacf8db8f60.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lil Baby net worth: how has the rapper earned all his riches?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He worked a lot to earn it. Just imagine, in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">eight career playoff games</a>, his achievements were: one hundred two tackles, eleven passes deflected, two interceptions for fifty-four yards, three forced fumbles, one fumble recovered, and one touchdown.</p><p class=align-left>From Ray Lewis biography it is known that he has always been fond of football. The sportsman became a football player when he was a young student of Kathleen High School. Later he was recruited to play at the University of Miami. In 1996, the Baltimore Ravens noticed him and it was their successful choice. Lewis led the team to a<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Super Bowl victory</a> in 2000, and, moreover, he was named Defensive Player of the Year.</p><p class=align-left>There is one interesting fact: in one of his interviews the man told the story of his becoming a footballer, and, as it appeared, the game was not his primary goal at that time. He recollected:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8b7dde88d805c248.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Everything about famous Master P net worth, career, and personal life!</span></p></a>"As a young child, my momma had me at 15 years old. My father walked out on my mom and left me in the incubator with no name. I'm 36 years old. I spent my first Father's Day with my father at 33 years old. Then my mom was in some rough relationships, and so we would see these bruises, and when we would see these black eyes on her face I would say, ‘Mom, why do you keep going through this?' And a lot of people always look at me, and they always say, ‘Man, how did you become this great football player?' It wasn't football that drove me. It was making sure a man would never put his hands on my mom again, is what drove me."<p class=align-left>This noble-minded goal led him to great achievements, and he managed not only to protect his mother but also to provide for her. Just in several years after the first Super Bowl victory, Lewis led the Ravens to another (the second one) Super Bowl victory. He was a valuable team member, and it is not surprising that four-year contract extension with the Ravens in 1998 made him the highest paid middle linebacker in the National Football League because it brought him <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$26 million</a>. It is was also counted that his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">highest yearly salary</a> was more than $10 million in 2002 due to a bonus of $10 million. In 2012 (that was the last year of his career), Lewis earned about $5 million.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7774cb069031bc20.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How much is Tyler Perry worth?

He was acknowledged the person who played in the biggest number of seasons (17), the player who conducted the most career games (228) and the man with the most career opponent fumbles recovered (20). In the whole, he gathered 2,643 career tackles, including a single-season team-best 225 stops in the year of 2003. He was merely adored by colleagues and fans and even was included into the Pro Football <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hall of Fame</a> in 2018. However, he was happy to retire. He said in one of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">press reports</a>:</p>“I’ve been going a long time. And now I can finally rest. I want to go fishing with a cigar now and just sit back. I don’t want to work out every day now.”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d90a0f399e9dbd16.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Daddy Yankee net worth and amazing career</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He is still young and strong.

They had a durable ten-year romance after they had first met at the University of Miami.</p><p class=align-left>Although he has no spouse for today, Ray Lewis family is big and therefore, it must be money consuming to provide for such a family. Perhaps you ask yourself a question: “How many children does Ray Lewis have?” The answer will impress you! He has six kids.

The matter is that the mother of the child claimed she wanted to get more than <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$3,500-a-month sum</a> of money from the father. In his turn, the footballer, asked the court<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> to provide guardianship </a>for his son because he was afraid that the woman could use his money to care about her other children from other men.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, it was not the only time when the sportsman appeared in court.</p><p class=align-left>Being one of the strongest players, this tall and big man managed to overdo with his power and appeared on the verge of being severely punished in 2000. The matter is that he and his friends went for the Super Bowl party at an Atlanta club where they got into a fight. It may seem a normal situation because conflicts occur in clubs from time to time, but it was not an ordinary fight, it was a fight where legendary Baltimore Ravens linebacker took part. As a result, two men – Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar were stabbed to death. The sportsman was arrested. However, the knife found at the crime scene did not match any fingerprint. In the process of the trial, the footballer was sentenced to one year of probation, and he was obliged to pay a fine of $250,000. His friends were acquitted too. Although the story had a kind of happy ending for the player, the man, in any case, should have used his potential more accurately and peacefully. However, in<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> one of his interviews</a> in 2010 he expressed a good idea about the life experience:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/314dc8fc424c6111.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most fascinating info about the Instagram star Brock O'hurn</span></p></a>“You ask me if I’d trade anything, and I couldn’t. I couldn’t because I wouldn’t be the man that I am today. The end result is who I am now. And that means if I had to go through all that again to come to the point of who I am right now, why change it?”<p class=align-left>When in 2018 the footballer was going to sell his house preferences concerning his luxurious life mode became clear. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The mansion price</a> was estimated at $1.89 million. The house was decorated in light-brown and white colours and measured 6,592 square feet. There were two floors, a chimney, a bowl collection room, a cosy family room with comfortable brown leather sofas, a bar, a billiard table, a cinema room, a sauna, a fountain outside and many other luxurious items.</p><p class=align-left>Ray Lewis net worth is more than enough for him to lead a quiet, luxurious life after retirement in the surrounding of six children.
