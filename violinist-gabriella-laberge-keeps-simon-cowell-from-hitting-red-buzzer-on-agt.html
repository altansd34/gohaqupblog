The violinist and singer was able to keep Simon Cowell from hitting his red buzzer. She enchanted him with her stunning voice. Gabriella’s audition has come as one of the biggest surprises of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 16.</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-agt-violinist-gabriella-laberge-captures-simon-cowell-s-attention-during-season-16-audition>‘AGT’ Violinist Gabriella Laberge Captures Simon Cowell’s Attention During Season 16 Audition</h2><p>Gabriella grew up watching AGT every week. She never expected to find herself on the world’s biggest stage ready to perform for the judges. Her biggest dream is to do music for the rest of her life. The AGT stage is a great place to make this dream happen. She started off her performance playing the violin. Cowell raised his hand above his red buzzer just seconds into the performance. Everything changed once Gabriella began to sing.</p><p>Gabriella’s angelic voice managed to put a smile back on Cowell’s face. He looked like he was captivated by Gabriella’s soft tone. All of the judges gave Gabriella a standing ovation and she looked like she was ready to burst into tears. Obviously, she was able to change Cowell’s mind, an accomplishment that is certainly not easy.</p><p>Music is more than just a passion for Gabriella. She gained an interest in music when she was 6 years old and began songwriting at the age of 8. When she was 11 years old, Gabriella broke her finger. This left her unable to play the violin for six months. She decided to use her other instrument, her voice.</p><p>Gabriella auditioned for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>The Voice France</a> in 2016 with Coldplay’s “The Scientist.” She added her own spin on the song by playing the violin. Once the coaches heard her beautiful voice, they knew immediately that they had to turn their chairs. Gabriella got all four coaches to turn their chairs and ended up choosing to be on Team Mika. She has been a fan of his since she was 15 years old.</p><p>Her audition for The Voice France now has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">over 72 million views.</a> The Voice was the first on-camera experience that Gabriella had. She learned English about 4 years before her audition. When she was 12, she listed to Avril Lavigne, Taylor Swift, and other classic rock bands and knew that she eventually wanted to release music in English.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Longtime fans of Gabriella’s know she also has a knack for taking on alternative rock and hip hop songs and making them her own. Such was the case for her performance of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Stressed Out”</a> by 21 Pilots. Gabriella was eliminated in the second week of live shows on The Voice France after performing “Aussi libre que moi” by Calogero.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gabriella-has-been-pursuing-her-passion-since-going-viral>Gabriella Has Been Pursuing Her Passion Since Going Viral</h2><p>Since appearing on the show, people are still buzzing about her audition and how unique of an artist she is. In 2018, Gabriella signed with Polydor&nbsp;France, a label under Universal Music Group. The following year, she competed in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Destination Eurovision</a> which allows France to select artists to represent the country at Eurovision. She sang her original song called “On Cherche Encore (Never Get Enough).”</p><p>Gabriella currently has 308,000 subscribers on YouTube that show love to all of her song covers. Last summer, she celebrated that her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>cover of the song “Zombie”</a> was featured on World of Dance. She was particularly excited about the fact that judge Jennifer Lopez heard her song in an Instagram post.</p><p>At the beginning of the year, Gabriella posted on Instagram about writing her next album in the mountains in western Canada. She teased the “next chapter” of her work. After taking a bit of an Instagram hiatus, Gabriella announced that she auditioned for AGT.</p><p>What did you think of Gabriella’s AGT audition?</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/thumbnail_photoByDavidDanielOtungaJr-AaronJThornton_Twitter-GettyImages.jpeg alt="Jennifer Hudson Shares Photo Of Her Son Next to ‘Respect’ Poster" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>simon cowell</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571aKmpaGensC1ecaamauhlaG5onnLmpmeqpeaeqyxxKmqZquZoryvecKorp6knGKzs7vMZp%2BirKSeu6h50Z6bZpqlr8emvoyopWaZl6l8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fviolinist-gabriella-laberge-keeps-simon-cowell-from-hitting-red-buzzer-on-agt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fviolinist-gabriella-laberge-keeps-simon-cowell-from-hitting-red-buzzer-on-agt.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fviolinist-gabriella-laberge-keeps-simon-cowell-from-hitting-red-buzzer-on-agt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fviolinist-gabriella-laberge-keeps-simon-cowell-from-hitting-red-buzzer-on-agt.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fviolinist-gabriella-laberge-keeps-simon-cowell-from-hitting-red-buzzer-on-agt.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fviolinist-gabriella-laberge-keeps-simon-cowell-from-hitting-red-buzzer-on-agt.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./48815-voters-want-cost-of-living-assistance-more-than-increased-funding-for-public-services.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./48815-voters-want-cost-of-living-assistance-more-than-increased-funding-for-public-services.html>Voters want cost-of-living assistance more than increased funding for public services</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./this-famous-swimsuit-runway-show-proved-that-beauty-cant-be-measured-in-years-or-pounds-808350.html>This Famous Swimsuit Runway Show Proved That Beauty Cant Be Measured in Years or Pounds</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./this-famous-swimsuit-runway-show-proved-that-beauty-cant-be-measured-in-years-or-pounds-808350.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
