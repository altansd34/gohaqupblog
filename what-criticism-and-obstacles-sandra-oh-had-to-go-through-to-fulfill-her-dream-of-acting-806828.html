<time>25 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Many know her face, but few know that she is&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=# title=actress data-link=tag>actress</a> who built her <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> from the ground&nbsp;up. Sandra Oh&nbsp;is&nbsp;mostly known for playing Cristina Yang on&nbsp;the hit series, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Grey’s Anatomy</i></a>. Although she is&nbsp;now a&nbsp;famed and respected actress, she’s faced hardships along the way that may have marked a&nbsp;different destiny for her.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> wants to&nbsp;share this actress’s story and how she didn’t let anything stop her from fulfilling her dreams.</p><p><h2>1. The start of&nbsp;her journey</h2></p><p>Sandra Oh&nbsp;was born in&nbsp;Canada after her parents decided to&nbsp;move from Korea when they were younger. She started taking ballet classes at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age, which was her first experience in&nbsp;the arts and what would make her discover at&nbsp;an&nbsp;early age that she liked show business. Although her parents didn’t approve, with the help of&nbsp;her sister, she participated in&nbsp;plays.</p><p>She then began to&nbsp;build her career as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;15&nbsp;with small parts in&nbsp;commercials. She continued with this dream in&nbsp;mind, and was so&nbsp;determined to&nbsp;pursue acting that she even turned down a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>scholarship</a> to&nbsp;study journalism.</p><p><h2>2. Her parents were her biggest driving force.</h2></p><p>At&nbsp;first, Sandra Oh’s parents weren’t really supportive of&nbsp;her acting career. For them, there was no&nbsp;good that could come from acting, and they constantly asked her to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;up. Their attitude of&nbsp;constant resistance to&nbsp;Oh’s wishes somehow made her a&nbsp;little stronger in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;the criticism that would come later.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “When you have 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;the most important people in&nbsp;your life telling you that you can’t do&nbsp;something, and you do&nbsp;it&nbsp;anyway, then it&nbsp;really doesn’t matter what anyone else says.” Still, Oh&nbsp;stayed the course, and they, despite their beliefs, watched her act and cement roles, enjoying what she did, and they became her biggest supporters and most loyal followers.</p><p><h2>3. Dealing with stereotypes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c5e/978/bbeb195842aca2ce8eef40e312.jpg><p>Being of&nbsp;Korean descent and living in&nbsp;Canada and then in&nbsp;Hollywood, Sandra Oh&nbsp;admitted that she felt different from others because of&nbsp;her looks. Within the acting world, it&nbsp;was not easy for her to&nbsp;deal with the ethnic and beauty stereotypes, which were not diverse enough and, in&nbsp;which, she felt she didn’t fit.</p><p>When she was in&nbsp;her twenties, an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>agent</a> told her she didn’t have the features to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;leading role, and she began to&nbsp;strongly consider <a href=# title="plastic surgery" data-link=tag>plastic surgery</a> to&nbsp;change her appearance. “I&nbsp;remember a&nbsp;plastic surgeon telling me&nbsp;that the lower half of&nbsp;my&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>face</a> was proper for a&nbsp;woman, but the upper half was not gender-specific.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0d6/10a/8d546a5027ac1c3d1be4df07b8.jpg><p>But the surgery never happened. One day, talking to&nbsp;her younger brother, he&nbsp;told her he&nbsp;didn’t think she needed to&nbsp;modify anything. He&nbsp;reminded her that she had recently landed a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;the movie, <i>The Diary of&nbsp;Evelyn Lau</i>, which was her first leading role that she landed thanks to&nbsp;a&nbsp;daring audition. She got the producers’ <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attention</a> when, at&nbsp;the audition, she asked for a&nbsp;moment to&nbsp;concentrate and got down on&nbsp;the floor for a&nbsp;few minutes. Her confidence charmed the film’s director, and she got the part.</p><p>It&nbsp;was her brother’s words that made her take a&nbsp;step back from the cosmetic operations on&nbsp;her face. He&nbsp;reminded her of&nbsp;what she was accomplishing by&nbsp;simply being herself, and that she was capable of&nbsp;playing strong and important roles without the need to&nbsp;fit into stereotypes.</p><p><h2>4. She said no&nbsp;to&nbsp;<i>Grey’s Anatomy</i>.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a1c/699/68961c5d37b699ba7dc81c1e7a.jpg><p>Dr. Cristina Yang in&nbsp;the series, <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i>, is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;Oh’s most iconic roles and one that made her popular around the world. That’s why few could imagine that the actress initially auditioned for another role in&nbsp;the series, even that of&nbsp;Dr. Miranda Bailey. She inquired about other available roles and found out she wanted to&nbsp;play Cristina Yang.</p><p>But before auditioning for the role, her agent advised her to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>leave</a>, as&nbsp;they were not going to&nbsp;accept the financial deal she was looking for, so&nbsp;she dropped out of&nbsp;the auditions. Despite that, producers were so&nbsp;interested in&nbsp;her that they kept looking for her to&nbsp;offer her the role she wanted to&nbsp;play.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/467/e2f/2edffc53a584a491eb05c36d27.jpg><p>For almost 10&nbsp;years, we&nbsp;enjoyed the many facets of&nbsp;the character that Sandra Oh&nbsp;played on&nbsp;the show that she herself helped to&nbsp;develop throughout the series. When she decided to&nbsp;leave, she said that she felt she had given everything she had to&nbsp;give to&nbsp;the character and that she felt extremely creative and at&nbsp;a&nbsp;point in&nbsp;her career where she could say “no” to&nbsp;more projects and wait for the right challenge; she now had the power to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>choose</a> her next jobs.</p><p><h2>5. Overwhelmed by&nbsp;fame</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c66/6e9/5c90075fc8af5f36eaecc12d65.jpg><p>After spending several years away from <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i>, the impact of&nbsp;her character continued to&nbsp;have traction with fans. “When you lose anonymity, you have to&nbsp;find tools to&nbsp;stay real.” Sandra Oh&nbsp;has stated that her experience with fame, at&nbsp;some points, was too overwhelming, and it&nbsp;was only with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>therapist</a> that she was able to&nbsp;deal with her emotions. She has learned to&nbsp;manage the excess attention and the expectation that others put on&nbsp;her, and to&nbsp;keep her feet on&nbsp;the ground.</p><p><h2>6. Staying true to&nbsp;herself in&nbsp;her roles</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/772/277/5024535ff68cc8e6a64c19edc6.jpg><p>Oh&nbsp;decided not to&nbsp;pigeonhole herself into one type of&nbsp;character, so&nbsp;she’s tried out different projects. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that what she looks for is&nbsp;to&nbsp;play dynamic and inspiring roles. And that is&nbsp;something we&nbsp;can definitely appreciate from her work.</p><p>Whether it’s comedic or&nbsp;dramatic projects, even before fame, she has developed strong, character roles. With memorable performances, she has managed to&nbsp;grow and capture a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;herself, demonstrating her conviction and that there is&nbsp;still much to&nbsp;discover about the talent that this great artist possesses.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you know anyone else who started with nothing, but managed to&nbsp;fulfill their lifelong dream?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmmquhpJ6wqr%2FMZpinnF2kr7TAwJyjnqtdqK6vsNGaZKigXZ2upXnTqGSgp12ptbO71KCfZqyfYrO2uMWio6VlmJq%2FbrDRnpimZZ%2BbeqKv06KloGVoZYN5fpdo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-criticism-and-obstacles-sandra-oh-had-to-go-through-to-fulfill-her-dream-of-acting-806828.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-criticism-and-obstacles-sandra-oh-had-to-go-through-to-fulfill-her-dream-of-acting-806828.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-criticism-and-obstacles-sandra-oh-had-to-go-through-to-fulfill-her-dream-of-acting-806828.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-criticism-and-obstacles-sandra-oh-had-to-go-through-to-fulfill-her-dream-of-acting-806828.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-criticism-and-obstacles-sandra-oh-had-to-go-through-to-fulfill-her-dream-of-acting-806828.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-criticism-and-obstacles-sandra-oh-had-to-go-through-to-fulfill-her-dream-of-acting-806828.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./agt-ventriloquists-terry-fator-celia-munoz-impress-in-spectacular-michael-jackson-duet.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./agt-ventriloquists-terry-fator-celia-munoz-impress-in-spectacular-michael-jackson-duet.html>'AGT' Ventriloquists Terry Fator, Celia Muoz Impress in Spectacular Michael Jackson Duet</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-19-celebs-would-look-like-if-their-faces-fit-the-golden-ratio-799126.html>What 19 Celebs Would Look Like If Their Faces Fit the Golden Ratio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-19-celebs-would-look-like-if-their-faces-fit-the-golden-ratio-799126.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
