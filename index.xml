He&amp;nbsp;debuted on&amp;nbsp;the big screen in&amp;nbsp;1981&amp;nbsp;and, even today, he&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;still in&amp;nbsp;great shape. However, like any good movie star, he&amp;nbsp;has some peculiar characteristics, such as&amp;nbsp;refusing the help of&amp;nbsp;specialists and separating from his wives when they reach a&amp;nbsp;certain age.
Bright Side has prepared a&amp;nbsp;list with some facts that show how Tom Cruise is&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;man very different from the rest.
1. He&amp;nbsp;has received many awards.

This is&amp;nbsp;because their experience, knowledge, and skills grow as&amp;nbsp;well as&amp;nbsp;their leniency and sense of&amp;nbsp;humor.
Bright Side made these comics to&amp;nbsp;show how different it&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;have the first child and the second one.
The delivery of&amp;nbsp;the first child is&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;fear of&amp;nbsp;the unknown, while with the second one, it’s the acceptance of&amp;nbsp;the inevitable.
The first child gives priceless knowledge which makes raising the second child so&amp;nbsp;much easier.</description></item><item><title>20 Celebrities Who Refuse to Join Social Media (They All Have Their Reasons)</title><link>/20-celebrities-who-refuse-to-join-social-media-they-all-have-their-reasons-801468.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/20-celebrities-who-refuse-to-join-social-media-they-all-have-their-reasons-801468.html</guid><description>The internet has become part of&amp;nbsp;the daily lives of&amp;nbsp;many people, and that of&amp;nbsp;course includes celebrities.

Discount e-commerce retailer Shein was founded in China in 2012 but only rose to prominence in the United States in the past couple of years, particularly among young women, riding simultaneous waves of pandemic-fueled interest in online shopping and inflation-fueled interest in low prices.
The brand’s stateside growth is also inextricably linked to the rise of TikTok, where posting #sheinhaul videos — in which users try on massive piles of Shein’s super-cheap clothes — has helped garner 11 billion views.</description></item><item><title>What does a Scotsman wear under his kilt?</title><link>/16706-what-does-scotsman-wear-under-his-kilt.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/16706-what-does-scotsman-wear-under-his-kilt.html</guid><description>New YouGov research reveals that nearly four in ten Scotsmen are going commando under their kiltsIt is an age old question, the butt of saucy postcard jokes and movie innuendo the world over: what does a Scotsman wear under his kilt?

And maybe not just any human, but ones that we&amp;nbsp;have encountered in&amp;nbsp;our daily lives. Sometimes they even bear a&amp;nbsp;slight resemblance to&amp;nbsp;other characters played by&amp;nbsp;real-life actors. Well, we’re sure everybody will agree that this is&amp;nbsp;the case with movies like Monsters, Inc. and Monsters University, in&amp;nbsp;which their charming characters are so&amp;nbsp;real and close to&amp;nbsp;us that there’s no&amp;nbsp;chance you haven’t asked yourself what they would look like if&amp;nbsp;they were human.</description></item><item><title>What the Characters From Twilight Were Supposed to Look Like According to the Books</title><link>/what-the-characters-from-twilight-were-supposed-to-look-like-according-to-the-books-801241.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/what-the-characters-from-twilight-were-supposed-to-look-like-according-to-the-books-801241.html</guid><description>We&amp;nbsp;all know that adapting literature to&amp;nbsp;film is&amp;nbsp;no&amp;nbsp;easy task. The possibilities are endless and you can experiment to&amp;nbsp;get the best results; however, it’s very difficult to&amp;nbsp;please everyone. As&amp;nbsp;for the characters, it’s always hard to&amp;nbsp;meet the expectations and descriptions of&amp;nbsp;the authors. Of&amp;nbsp;course, the Twilight saga, written by&amp;nbsp;Stephenie Meyer, is&amp;nbsp;no&amp;nbsp;exception. In&amp;nbsp;the books, the main character, Bella Swan, narrates the story, and it’s through her eyes that we&amp;nbsp;get to&amp;nbsp;know the rest of&amp;nbsp;the characters. Even though the movies generally did a&amp;nbsp;very good job at&amp;nbsp;adapting the story, there are a&amp;nbsp;few details that make some of&amp;nbsp;the characters look slightly different from the ones that readers met through the books.</description></item><item><title>'The Voice' is Currently Holding a Virtual Casting Call Open for All Singers</title><link>/the-voice-is-currently-holding-a-virtual-casting-call-open-for-all-singers.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/the-voice-is-currently-holding-a-virtual-casting-call-open-for-all-singers.html</guid><description>TALENTRECAP.COM Singing The Voice

In&amp;nbsp;movies and&amp;nbsp;TV shows, where moviemakers introduce a&amp;nbsp;certain profession to&amp;nbsp;us, we&amp;nbsp;can often see that 2&amp;nbsp;people working with each other slowly become closer.

Given this, many commentators queried why the government seemed determined to press ahead with tax cuts, given the public’s clearly-stated preference for fixing public services.
However, ahead of the 2024 Budget, new poll findings call into question this preference for putting more money towards public services.</description></item><item><title>Watford? Romford? Dartford?

It&amp;nbsp;can develop into a&amp;nbsp;significant concern impacting one’s self-image and appearance, even though it’s not that dangerous overall.
The definition of&amp;nbsp;dandruff
Dandruff occurs when the skin on&amp;nbsp;the scalp sheds off in&amp;nbsp;the form of&amp;nbsp;white flakes, which are highly visible on&amp;nbsp;dark hair and may cause itching at&amp;nbsp;times. The reason behind the occurrence of&amp;nbsp;dandruff is&amp;nbsp;the speedy renewal of&amp;nbsp;skin cells. In&amp;nbsp;general, healthy skin cells follow a&amp;nbsp;specific life cycle where they grow, age, and die, making way for new cells.</description></item><item><title>Why We Shouldnt Use the Same Towel More Than 2 Days in a Row</title><link>/why-we-shouldnt-use-the-same-towel-more-than-2-days-in-a-row-805499.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/why-we-shouldnt-use-the-same-towel-more-than-2-days-in-a-row-805499.html</guid><description>We&amp;nbsp;all look forward to&amp;nbsp;the refreshing morning shower that helps&amp;nbsp;us wake&amp;nbsp;up, and we&amp;nbsp;can’t wait for our evening bath ritual to&amp;nbsp;wash all the stress away.

And working on&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;series with many seasons and episodes can stretch to&amp;nbsp;10+&amp;nbsp;years. At&amp;nbsp;the same time, life goes on&amp;nbsp;and stars can get married or&amp;nbsp;have kids within this period. However, confessing their pregnancy to&amp;nbsp;colleagues and on-set bosses is&amp;nbsp;always a&amp;nbsp;big stress for actresses. All because it&amp;nbsp;might not fit into the script and in&amp;nbsp;this case, the celebrity risks losing her job.

Certain behavior is&amp;nbsp;acceptable for one group of&amp;nbsp;people or&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;certain person and is&amp;nbsp;frowned upon for others. In&amp;nbsp;some cases, it’s men who are discriminated against, and in&amp;nbsp;other instances, it’s women that are judged. The actions of&amp;nbsp;people who differ in&amp;nbsp;age or&amp;nbsp;the way they look can also be&amp;nbsp;interpreted subjectively.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side often come across situations that lack fairness, but everyone is&amp;nbsp;so&amp;nbsp;used to&amp;nbsp;this way of&amp;nbsp;thinking that we&amp;nbsp;don’t even notice&amp;nbsp;it.</description></item><item><title>15 Logos of Famous Brands That Have Changed Over the Past 50 Years</title><link>/15-logos-of-famous-brands-that-have-changed-over-the-past-50-years-803706.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/15-logos-of-famous-brands-that-have-changed-over-the-past-50-years-803706.html</guid><description>BBC’s logo costs a&amp;nbsp;whopping $1.8&amp;nbsp;billion.

And it’s not just a&amp;nbsp;financial risk since the brand can lose its identity if&amp;nbsp;the logo isn’t done well. Fortunately, some companies we&amp;nbsp;know took a&amp;nbsp;chance and, over time, gave their logos a&amp;nbsp;more modern look.

Some of&amp;nbsp;them were already pretty popular back then (like Brat Pitt and Julia Roberts), while others had only recently got under the spotlight (like Dakota Fanning and Giovanni Ribisi).
Bright Side rewatched this hilarious&amp;nbsp;TV series and was quite surprised at&amp;nbsp;how many celebrities were on&amp;nbsp;this show.

Unfortunately, other species such as&amp;nbsp;white lions and tigers are endangered since their rare colors attract poachers.

And when something like this happens, the relationship between the grandparents and their grandchildren suffers a&amp;nbsp;lot. The reason that most of&amp;nbsp;the time in-laws don’t create a&amp;nbsp;nice relationship with their son’s wife is&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;lack of&amp;nbsp;acceptance. They have trouble welcoming this new member into their family and that’s why they create a&amp;nbsp;somewhat hostile environment.
Bright Side is&amp;nbsp;optimistic that most relationships can work if&amp;nbsp;both sides are communicating openly and respecting each other’s feelings.</description></item><item><title>8 Ways to Get Rid of Bugs in Your House</title><link>/7-ways-to-get-rid-of-insects-in-your-house-that-actually-work-600110.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/7-ways-to-get-rid-of-insects-in-your-house-that-actually-work-600110.html</guid><description>Have you ever wondered how to&amp;nbsp;get rid of&amp;nbsp;the annoying bugs that live in&amp;nbsp;your house?
