Sometimes however, the judges on the show can be almost as entertaining as the contestants themselves. Over the years, the BGT panel has welcomed a number of different judges. From series to series, the BGT panel may look a little different, but they all served a unique purpose during their time on the show. Who is your favorite Britain’s Got Talent judge?</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-david-hasselhoff>7. David Hasselhoff</h2><p>The well-known American actor appeared as a judge on Britain’s Got Talent in series five. That year, he joined the likes of Michael McIntyre as replacements for <a href=#>Piers Morgan</a> and Simon Cowell. Hasselhoff was reportedly “extremely excited” to become a judge on the new series, and was thrilled when he got the call from Cowell.</p><p>However, after his stint on series five, viewers discovered that he had been let go from the show. It was believed that “The Hoff” would bring an abundance of laughter to the show, however he didn’t really connect with the acts. An additional reason for his departure was that he had trouble understanding the contestant’s accents. Kind of an issue when you’re judging a show in a different country.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-michael-mcintyre>6. Michael McIntyre</h2><p>Comedian Michael McIntyre also served a short-lived stint on series five of Britain’s Got Talent. While he tried to deliver personality and comic relief, the judge felt his role on the show was “too much of a departure” from his on-stage career. McIntyre ultimately decided to quit the show after one series.</p><p>“It was a different thing for me to do because obviously I work very hard to be a comedian and perform on stage and then to sit and judge other people was an odd experience, because it’s not something I’m used to,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>. “It was wonderful to do, but I was just desperate to get back on stage and I didn’t get the feeling that anyone was watching the show for my judging.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-piers-morgan>5. Piers Morgan</h2><p id=h-the-journalist-and-television-personality-served-as-a-judge-on-series-one-through-four-of-britain-s-got-talent-from-his-stint-on-the-show-morgan-can-definitely-be-classified-as-the-mean-judge-he-was-very-quick-to-buzz-his-x-on-any-act-he-deemed-silly-unworthy-or-had-any-mistakes-if-any-judge-were-to-press-their-buzzer-morgan-was-typically-the-first-on-the-flip-side-however-morgan-did-give-props-to-the-acts-he-felt-could-make-it-far-in-the-competition>The journalist and television personality served as a judge on series one through four of Britain’s Got Talent. From his stint on the show, Morgan could definitely be classified as the “mean judge.” He was quick to buzz his “X” on any act he deemed silly, unworthy, or had any mistakes. If any judge were to press their buzzer, Morgan was typically the first.</p><p id=h-the-journalist-and-television-personality-served-as-a-judge-on-series-one-through-four-of-britain-s-got-talent-from-his-stint-on-the-show-morgan-can-definitely-be-classified-as-the-mean-judge-he-was-very-quick-to-buzz-his-x-on-any-act-he-deemed-silly-unworthy-or-had-any-mistakes-if-any-judge-were-to-press-their-buzzer-morgan-was-typically-the-first-on-the-flip-side-however-morgan-did-give-props-to-the-acts-he-felt-could-make-it-far-in-the-competition>Oftentimes, Morgan’s harsh critiques would cause tension among other judges on the panel and even with the audience. On the flip side however, Morgan did give props to the acts he felt could make it far in the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-alesha-dixon>4. Alesha Dixon</h2><p>The professional singer and former girl group member has been a judge on Britain’s Got Talent since series six. Dixon is known for being kind and offering constructive criticism to the acts. With her background, she is particularly a fan of musical acts. R&B and soul acts are definitely her niche.</p><p>Dixon is also known for her fondness of dance. In fact, in 2007, she won the fifth series of BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing. A number of her favorite acts on the show have been of the dance variety, as she often was able to provide her professional opinion.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-david-walliams>3. David Walliams</h2><p><a href=#>David Walliams</a> is a children’s entertainer and comedian who has been a judge on Britain’s Got Talent since series six. Walliams’s bold and wacky sense of humor definitely keep things fun and interesting on the panel.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of his Golden Buzzer acts have not make it past the audition stage. Though it seems Walliams may not have the best eye for talent, his thought process is out of the box, and keeps the show interesting for viewers. Walliams rightfully proved to be a fan of comedy acts, and uses his expertise to keep a steady flow of laughter on the series.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-amanda-holden>2. Amanda Holden</h2><p>Since 2007, English actress and media personality, <a href=#>Amanda Holden</a>, has judged Britain’s Got Talent. She is a certified staple of the show, and oftentimes considered the most memorable judge. Holden is a fair, charismatic, and fashionable judge to say the least.</p><p>Out of all the current judges, she possesses the most diverse taste in acts, while also offering a well-balanced view. Often, her judging can be overshadowed by outfits that some viewers consider to be “inappropriate.” Nevertheless, Holden holds great pride as a BGT judge and chooses acts that make her “proud to be British.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-simon-cowell>1. Simon Cowell</h2><p>I don’t think the number one ranking should come as much of a surprise here. The one and only <a href=#>Simon Cowell </a>is not only as a judge on BGT, but as the creator of the Got Talent franchise. Cowell has made an appearance on the panel in every series of the British leg since its debut.</p><p>While back in the day he used to take the title of the “harsh judge” his heart has seemingly softened over the years. He is particularly kind to acts involving <a href=#>children and animals</a>. He has even had to put Morgan in his place once or twice for being “too mean.” As he is the owner of his own record label, Cowell has always been known to offer advice to singers in the competition. In fact, five out of his eight <a href=#>Golden Buzzers</a> have all been singers. While Cowell takes the top spot in the BGT ranking, he pretty much will come in first place no matter what show he’s a part of.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/orvuuyQaVco</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Whats-Hot-90.jpeg alt="Watch the 10 Most Shocking Moments from ‘Dancing with the Stars’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZpqVqMFurtGiq5qhnqh6qLvTZquapJWjwW621J2enqtdp66vt8SdZLCgn2LBorfErGStoJViwbC8jKynqKxf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-best-britains-got-talent-judges-ranked-who-takes-the-top-spot.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-best-britains-got-talent-judges-ranked-who-takes-the-top-spot.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-best-britains-got-talent-judges-ranked-who-takes-the-top-spot.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-best-britains-got-talent-judges-ranked-who-takes-the-top-spot.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-best-britains-got-talent-judges-ranked-who-takes-the-top-spot.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-britains-got-talent-judges-ranked-who-takes-the-top-spot.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-voice-recap-the-blind-auditions-continue-with-a-shocking-four-chair-turn.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-voice-recap-the-blind-auditions-continue-with-a-shocking-four-chair-turn.html>The Blind Auditions Continue With A SHOCKING Four-Chair Turn</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gender-in-spanish.html>The basic guide to gender rules in Spanish</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gender-in-spanish.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
