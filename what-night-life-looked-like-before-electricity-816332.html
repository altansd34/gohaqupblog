One of&nbsp;the streetlights flickers and goes out. You are now in&nbsp;the dark. Feeling scared? Now you know how people felt after sundown in&nbsp;the pre-electricity era.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/669/f18/6294605d42b93caba210b872f9.png><p>We&nbsp;are so&nbsp;used to&nbsp;power that we&nbsp;forget that it&nbsp;isn’t even a&nbsp;century old. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>In&nbsp;1925</u></a>, only half of&nbsp;all&nbsp;US homes had electricity. Without&nbsp;it, nothing would be&nbsp;possible today. The light in&nbsp;your room, the refrigerator, store signs, and credit cards: they all need electricity to&nbsp;run. So, how did people live without&nbsp;it? Did our cities lie in&nbsp;complete darkness? Not quite. The history of&nbsp;illuminating our homes and streets is&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;years old.</p><p>Recently [2022], archeologists discovered the oldest intact oil lamp. They estimated it&nbsp;was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>2,300 years old</u></a>. There is&nbsp;evidence of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>workshops that produced these lamps</u></a> on&nbsp;a&nbsp;massive scale. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Italian scientists have discovered similar lamps in&nbsp;Modena</u></a>. This city was the center of&nbsp;oil lamp production in&nbsp;the Roman Empire. The workshops were so&nbsp;widespread that they even had different brands [Fortis, Phoetaspi, and Strobili]. Some brands were in&nbsp;high demand, so&nbsp;other manufacturers copied their maker’s marks. And you thought that fakes were a&nbsp;modern problem.</p><p>These oil lamps were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>simple in&nbsp;design</u></a>. High-end lamps were made from bronze and other metals. But the most common material was clay. People would pour oil through the central hole and then burn a&nbsp;wick inside the nozzle area. The wick was mostly linen. But oil lamps were small in&nbsp;size and were used indoors. There was no&nbsp;way to&nbsp;light a&nbsp;whole street with them. The alternative was, you’ve guessed&nbsp;it: candles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/90c/3f7/42cf845b3f9104b98eec0b5cd2.png><p>Humans still use candles today. Your grandma probably has a&nbsp;candle and a&nbsp;box of&nbsp;matches hidden in&nbsp;a&nbsp;drawer somewhere. Just in&nbsp;case of&nbsp;a&nbsp;power outage. Humans have been making candles for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>five thousand years</u></a>. When you think of&nbsp;a&nbsp;candle, you think of&nbsp;beeswax. But the range of&nbsp;candle materials is&nbsp;pretty wide. In&nbsp;the Middle Ages, only the rich could afford beeswax candles. The rest of&nbsp;the population had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy with tallow. By&nbsp;modern standards, candles have terrible energy efficiency.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you remember the time when you first saw a&nbsp;candle and tried to&nbsp;touch&nbsp;it? Ouch. You never got that idea again, did you? Candles use a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;energy to&nbsp;generate heat. That’s why they are far from ideal light sources. And the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>light they emit is&nbsp;not the kind we&nbsp;need</u></a>. It’s infrared. Humans cannot see this sort of&nbsp;light. The numbers are staggering: Only one percent of&nbsp;candlelight is&nbsp;visible to&nbsp;us humans. Modern light bulbs are way more efficient. They shine 80&nbsp;times brighter than candles.</p><p>In&nbsp;such dim conditions, our ancestors had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;imaginative. For instance, they covered artwork with a&nbsp;thin layer of&nbsp;gold. This technique was called gold leaf. Artists didn’t do&nbsp;this to&nbsp;make their artwork look luxurious. They wanted their paintings to&nbsp;glow in&nbsp;the candlelight. And they had another ally in&nbsp;the struggle against darkness. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Natural light</u></a>. Have you ever wondered why old churches have tall, elongated windows? Their main function was to&nbsp;let sunlight inside. After all, these structures were huge. There was no&nbsp;other way to&nbsp;illuminate them. Just take <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Notre Dame</u></a> [<a href=# title=Paris data-link=tag>Paris</a>, <a href=# title=France data-link=tag>France</a>] as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example. It&nbsp;covers an&nbsp;area <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>four times</u></a> as&nbsp;large as&nbsp;a&nbsp;hockey rink. And the building was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>211 feet high</u></a>. That’s about <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>half as&nbsp;tall as&nbsp;the Great Pyramid of&nbsp;Giza</u></a>. So&nbsp;it&nbsp;made sense to&nbsp;build large windows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8e9/0c8/5301be595590bbfb717ecc65a5.png><p>In&nbsp;homes, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>mirrors</u></a> had the same effect as&nbsp;windows. They would reflect natural light around the house. Before electricity, our homes were packed with mirrors. And how many do&nbsp;we&nbsp;have today? One in&nbsp;the bathroom and maybe one in&nbsp;the hallway? That’s because we&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer need them to&nbsp;reflect light. All those mirrors have been replaced with a&nbsp;simple flip of&nbsp;a&nbsp;light switch. Today, interior <a href=# title=designers data-link=tag>designers</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>advise people to&nbsp;remove mirrors from their bedrooms</u></a> for better sleep. Talk about a&nbsp;plot twist.</p><p>But what about buildings that people visited at&nbsp;nighttime, such as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>theaters and opera houses</u></a>? The solution was surprisingly low-tech. Candles. Like, thousands of&nbsp;them. Builders mounted them on&nbsp;large chandeliers. But there was a&nbsp;problem. All those candles created heat and would burn for an&nbsp;hour or&nbsp;so, max. Playwrights and composers had to&nbsp;add pauses, so&nbsp;staff would have time to&nbsp;replace the candles.</p><p>Have you ever shattered a&nbsp;light bulb by&nbsp;accident? Not a&nbsp;pleasant experience. But luckily, you can clean the glass with a&nbsp;broom in&nbsp;seconds. Before electricity, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>such clumsiness</u></a> cost people their lives. Knocking over a&nbsp;candle could start a&nbsp;major fire. And there was another danger. Ladies wore long dresses that presented a&nbsp;fire hazard. Our ancestors were literally playing with fire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/294/313/ed2fd556d6afeaaa91bdddd0a3.png><p>And this is&nbsp;all indoors. Outside the house, you would have to&nbsp;carry a&nbsp;flaming torch. Or&nbsp;hope that the sky wasn’t cloudy, so&nbsp;you could navigate by&nbsp;moonlight. And one smart American decided not to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out at&nbsp;night at&nbsp;all. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Benjamin Franklin</u></a> went to&nbsp;bed at&nbsp;10&nbsp;PM and got up&nbsp;at&nbsp;5&nbsp;AM. But over in&nbsp;London, going out at&nbsp;night created a&nbsp;new business. Link boys <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>carried torches for Victorians</u></a>. These youngsters would wait outside inns for patrons to&nbsp;come out after dark and offer their services. And they did their job in&nbsp;times of&nbsp;thick fog as&nbsp;well. That’s the English weather for you.</p><p>Before electricity, it&nbsp;was dangerous to&nbsp;go&nbsp;outside after sundown. But this was about to&nbsp;change in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>1807</u></a>. That’s when a&nbsp;German engineer [Frederick Winsor] lit a&nbsp;street in&nbsp;London using gas lamps. It&nbsp;was finally becoming possible to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out at&nbsp;night and feel safe. Now, these gas lamps weren’t easy to&nbsp;operate. At&nbsp;dusk, a&nbsp;lamplighter had to&nbsp;carry a&nbsp;torch to&nbsp;turn them&nbsp;on, so&nbsp;to&nbsp;say. And then, at&nbsp;dawn, they had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;another round to&nbsp;put out the flames. That sounds like some good cardio. And it&nbsp;was. During their entire career, a&nbsp;lamplighter could easily walk <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>150 thousand miles</u></a> in&nbsp;total.</p><p>And then came electricity. In&nbsp;the 1870s, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Thomas Edison</u></a> was the first to&nbsp;produce commercial light bulbs. A&nbsp;city in&nbsp;the west of&nbsp;Romania [Timisoara] became the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>first place in&nbsp;Europe</u></a> to&nbsp;have electric streetlights. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Half of&nbsp;the homes in&nbsp;Britain</u></a> had electric power by&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 1930s. The age of&nbsp;electricity had begun. But there was still room for improvement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/148/f64/435b435caab9c5deb853d2a279.png><p>At&nbsp;the time, the most common type of&nbsp;light bulb was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>incandescent</u></a>. This means that the light bulb has a&nbsp;filament inside that produces light when heated by&nbsp;electric power. This type of&nbsp;bulb is&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;a&nbsp;candle. It&nbsp;produces heat rather than light. And the ratio will stun you.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>95% of&nbsp;the electricity</u></a> that flows through the light bulb is&nbsp;converted into heat. Yes, you’ve heard it&nbsp;right. Only&nbsp;5% of&nbsp;energy is&nbsp;used for creating actual light. Despite this, electric power has changed the way we&nbsp;live.</p><p>In&nbsp;the year <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>1800</u></a>, only two percent of&nbsp;the world’s population lived in&nbsp;cities. And there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;good reason for this. Cities were dark places, illuminated only by&nbsp;candles and oil lamps. There was no&nbsp;street lighting. After electricity became a&nbsp;thing, the numbers turned. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>According to&nbsp;the World Bank</u></a>, more than half of&nbsp;the world’s population [56%] lives in&nbsp;cities today. And our urban settlements look a&nbsp;lot different than they did just a&nbsp;century and a&nbsp;half ago. They now shine bright on&nbsp;satellite images. From space, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Las Vegas</u></a> is&nbsp;the city that shines the brightest at&nbsp;night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a29/4f5/8aac26585aa47bd71cee0eedff.png><p>But the story of&nbsp;illumination is&nbsp;far from over. In&nbsp;2006, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Ann Arbor</u></a> [Michigan, US] became the first metropolitan area to&nbsp;use LED for street lighting. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;short for light-emitting diodes. This new type of&nbsp;lighting uses at&nbsp;least&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>75% less energy</u></a> than the light bulb perfected by&nbsp;Edison in&nbsp;the 1800s. And they last longer, too: up&nbsp;to&nbsp;25&nbsp;times.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmpaKfmKl6rbXFnmSlp5%2BgsqV5y6KinmWSmrOwvsRmnKWdk6m%2Fqq%2FIrbBmcGFrgHR%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-night-life-looked-like-before-electricity-816332.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-night-life-looked-like-before-electricity-816332.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-night-life-looked-like-before-electricity-816332.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-night-life-looked-like-before-electricity-816332.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-night-life-looked-like-before-electricity-816332.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-night-life-looked-like-before-electricity-816332.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-the-cast-from-sabrina-1996-looks-like-vs-the-cast-from-the-netflix-version-795840.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-the-cast-from-sabrina-1996-looks-like-vs-the-cast-from-the-netflix-version-795840.html>What the Cast From Sabrina 1996 Looks Like vs the Cast From the Netflix Version</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-stop-wearing-pants-804692.html>What Happens to Your Body If You Stop Wearing Pants</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-stop-wearing-pants-804692.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
