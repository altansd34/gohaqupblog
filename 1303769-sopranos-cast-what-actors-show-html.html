The actor had a trademark talent for portraying somewhat brutish but altogether charming characters with a kind heart.</p><p class=align-left>The actor was found unconscious by his son on June 19, 2013. James was lying on the bathroom floor. He was killed by a sudden heart attack while in Rome. He was supposed to travel to Sicily the next day to attend the Taormina Film Fest and receive another award. James Gandolfini was only 51.</p><h3>Edie Falco (portrayed Carmela Soprano)</h3><p class=align-left>After the show was over, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Edie Falco</a> took up the role of a congresswoman in <i>30 Rock</i>, and her comical performance was very successful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/aa2e3c96522b8997.jpeg><p class=align-left>The role in <i>30 Rock</i> earned the actress an Emmy nomination. When Edie's collaboration with the show ended, she starred in <i>Nurse Jackie</i> and got a handful of nominations for popular awards.

She walked down the aisle with Cutter Dykstra in 2016 and gave birth to two children.</p><h3>Robert Iler (portrayed AJ Soprano)</h3><p class=align-left>When <i>The Sopranos</i> show was over, so was Iler's acting career. He was seen on <i>Law & Order</i> (just one episode) in 2009.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/11c05ee90b763687.jpeg><p class=align-left>In July 2001, the young man was arrested together with two friends.
